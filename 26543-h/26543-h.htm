<p>Dear Priscilla:</p>
<p>You have taken such a fancy to little
Clematis that we hope other children may
like her, too. We may not be able to buy
you all the ponies, and goats, and dogs,
and cats that you would like, but we will
dedicate the book to you, and then you
can play with all the animals Clematis
has, any time you wish.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>LOST IN THE BIG CITY</h3>
</div>

<p>It was early Spring. A warm
sun shone down upon the city
street. On the edge of the
narrow brick sidewalk a little girl
was sitting.</p>
<p>Her gingham dress was old and
shabby. The short, brown coat
had lost all its buttons, and a rusty
pin held it together.</p>
<p>A faded blue cap partly covered
her brown hair, which hung in
short, loose curls around her face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></p>
<p>She had been sitting there almost
an hour when a policeman
came along.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder where that girl
belongs,&#8221; he said, as he looked
down at her. &#8220;She is a new one
on Chambers Street.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked on, but he looked
back as he walked, to see if she
went away.</p>
<p>The child slowly raised her big,
brown eyes to look after him. She
watched him till he reached the
corner by the meat shop; then she
looked down and began to kick at
the stones with her thin boots.</p>
<p>At this moment a bell rang. A
door opened in a building across the
street, and many children came out.</p>
<p>As they passed the little girl,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
some of them looked at her. One
little boy bent down to see her
face, but she hid it under her arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you afraid of?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;Who&#8217;s going to hurt
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not answer.</p>
<p>Another boy opened his lunch
box as he passed, and shook out
the pieces of bread, left from his
lunch.</p>
<p>Soon the children were gone,
and the street was quiet again.</p>
<p>The little girl kicked at the
stones a few minutes; then she
looked up. No one was looking
at her, so she reached out one little
hand and picked up a crust of bread.</p>
<p>In a wink the bread was in her
mouth. She reached out for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
another, brushed off a little dirt,
and ate that also.</p>
<p>Just then the policeman came
down the street from the other
corner. The child quickly bent
her head and looked down.</p>
<p>This time he came to where
she sat, and stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to sit here all
day, little girl?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>She did not answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your mother will be looking
for you. You&#8217;d better run home
now, like a good girl. Where do
you live, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>He bent down and lifted her
chin, so she had to look up at
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you live, miss? Tell
us now, that&#8217;s a good girl.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; The child
spoke slowly, half afraid.</p>
<p>&#8220;O come now, of course you
know, a big girl like you ought to
know. What&#8217;s the name of the
street?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you&#8217;re only afraid of me.
Don&#8217;t be afraid of Jim Cunneen
now. I&#8217;ve a little girl at home
just about your age.&#8221;</p>
<p>He waited for her to answer,
but she said nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come miss, you must think.
How can I take you home if you
don&#8217;t tell me where you live?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear me! That is all I
get for an answer. Well then,
I&#8217;ll have to take you down to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
station. May be you will find a
tongue down there.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke, he took hold of
her arm to help her up. Then
he tried one more question.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Clematis.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she spoke she moved her
arm, and out from the coat peeped
a kitten. It was white, with a
black spot over one eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, that is better,&#8221; answered
the policeman. &#8220;Now
tell me your last name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is all the name I have,
just Clematis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, what is your
father&#8217;s name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that is too bad, dear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
Then tell me your mother&#8217;s
name.&#8221; He bent down lower to
hear her reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any mother, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No father? No mother?&#8221;
The policeman lifted her gently to
her feet. &#8220;Well miss, we won&#8217;t
stay here any longer. It is getting
late.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then the kitten stuck its
head out from her coat and said,
&#8220;Miew.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed very glad to move on.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that now, a cat?
Where did you get that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my kitty, my very own,
so I kept it. I didn&#8217;t steal it.
Its name is Deborah, and it is my
very own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, now she is finding her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
tongue,&#8221; said the policeman,
smiling; while Clematis hugged
the kitten.</p>
<p>But the little girl could tell him
no more, so he led her along the
street toward the police station.</p>
<p>Before they had gone very far,
they passed a baker&#8217;s shop.</p>
<p>In the window were rolls,
and cookies, and buns, and little
cakes with jam and frosting on
them.</p>
<p>The smell of fresh bread came
through the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter, miss?&#8221;
The man looked down, as Clematis
stood still before the window.</p>
<p>She was looking through the
glass, at the rolls, and cakes, and
cookies.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 303px;'>

</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></div>
<p>The policeman smelled the
fresh bread, and it made him
hungry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you hungry, little girl?&#8221;
he asked, looking down with a
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you be hungry if
you hadn&#8217;t had anything to eat
all day long?&#8221; Clematis looked
up at him with tears in her big
brown eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to eat all day? Why,
you must be nearly starved!&#8221; As
he spoke, the policeman started
into the store, pulling Clematis
after him.</p>
<p>She was so surprised that she
almost dropped her kitten.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miew,&#8221; said poor Deborah, as
if she knew they were going to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
starve no longer. But it was
really because she was squeezed so
tight she couldn&#8217;t help it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Clematis, do you
see anything there you like?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Cunneen smiled down at
Clematis, as she peeped through
the glass case at the things inside.</p>
<p>She stood silent, with her nose
right against the glass.</p>
<p>There were so many things to
eat it almost took her breath
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you say, little
girl? Don&#8217;t you see anything you
like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I choose anything I
want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, miss. Just pick out what
you like best.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>The lady behind the counter
smiled, as the policeman lifted
Clematis a little, so she could see
better. There were cakes, and
cookies, and buns, and doughnuts.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I have a cream cake?&#8221;
asked Clematis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you may. What
else?&#8221; He lifted her a bit higher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miew!&#8221; said Deborah, from
under her coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, excuse me, cat,&#8221; he said,
as he set Clematis down. &#8220;I forgot
you were there too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman laughed, as she
took out a cream cake, a cookie
with nuts on it, and a doughnut.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I eat them now?&#8221; asked
Clematis, as she took the bag.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You start right in, and if
that&#8217;s not enough, you can have
more. But don&#8217;t forget the
cat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Cunneen laughed with the
baker woman, while Clematis
began to eat the doughnut, as
they started out.</p>
<p>Before long they came to a
brick building that had big
doors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are,&#8221; said the policeman.
They turned, and went
inside.</p>
<p>There another policeman was
sitting at a desk behind a railing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, who comes here?&#8221; asked
the policeman at the desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is more than I know,&#8221;
replied Jim Cunneen. &#8220;I guess
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
she&#8217;s lost out of the flower show.
She says her name is Clematis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis said nothing. Her
mouth was full of cream cake now,
and a little cream was running
over her fingers.</p>
<p>Deborah was silent also. She
was eating the last crumbs of the
doughnut.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all you could find out?&#8221;
The other man looked at Clematis.</p>
<p>&#8220;She says she has no father
and no mother. Her cat is named
Deborah. That is all she told
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, I guess you scared
her, Jim. Let me ask her. I&#8217;ll
find out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new policeman smiled at
Clematis. &#8220;Come on now, sister,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
he said. &#8220;Tell us where you live.
That&#8217;s a good girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis reached up one hand
and took hold of her friend&#8217;s big
finger. She looked at the new
policeman a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you didn&#8217;t know where you
lived, how could you tell anyone?&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>Jim Cunneen laughed. He liked
to feel her little hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;See how scared she is of me,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;We are old friends
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again they asked the little girl
all the questions they could think
of. But it was of no use. She
could not tell them where she
lived. She would not tell them
very much about herself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>At last the Captain came in.
They told him about this queer
little girl.</p>
<p>He asked her questions also.
Then he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall have to send her to
the Home. If anyone claims
her he can find her there.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Clematis and Deborah were
tucked into the big station wagon,
and Jim Cunneen took her to the
Home, where lost children are
sheltered and fed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE CHILDREN&#8217;S HOME</h3>
</div>

<p>As they climbed the steps
leading to the Home, Clematis
looked up at the policeman.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this place?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the Children&#8217;s Home,
miss. You will have a fine time
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>A young woman with a kind
face opened the door.</p>
<p>The policeman did not go in.
&#8220;Here is a child I found on
Chambers Street,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We
can&#8217;t find out where she lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; said the woman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Could you take her in for
a while, till we can find her
parents?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess we have room
for her. Come in, little girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment there was a
scratching sound, and Deborah
stuck her head out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miew,&#8221; said Deborah, who
was still hungry. Perhaps she
thought it was another bakery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; cried the young
woman, &#8220;we can&#8217;t have that cat
in here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis drew back, and reached
for Jim Cunneen&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very nice cat, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221;
said the policeman.</p>
<p>He felt sorry for Clematis. He
knew how she loved her kitten.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s against the rules.
The children can never have cats
or dogs in here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis, with tears in her
eyes, turned away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; she said to her
big friend. &#8220;Let us go.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jim Cunneen drew her
back. He loved little girls, and
was also fond of cats.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think the cook
might need it for a day or two, to
catch the rats?&#8221; he asked, with his
best smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh dear me, I don&#8217;t know. I
don&#8217;t think so. It&#8217;s against the
rules for children to bring in pets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah then, just wait a minute.
I&#8217;ll be right back.&#8221;</p>
<p>The policeman ran down the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
steps and around the corner of the
house, while the young woman
asked Clematis questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right then, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221;
he called as he came back. &#8220;Katie
says she would be very glad to
have that cat to help her catch
the rats.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young woman laughed;
Clematis dried her tears, and Jim
Cunneen waved his hand and said
goodby.</p>
<p>In another moment the door
opened, and Clematis, with Deborah
still in her arms, was in her
new home.</p>
<p>It was supper hour at the
Children&#8217;s Home. In the big
dining room three long tables were
set.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>At each place on the clean,
bare table was a plate, a small
yellow bowl, and a spoon.</p>
<p>Beside each plate was a blue
gingham bib.</p>
<p>Jane, one of the girls in the
Home, was filling the bowls on
her table with milk from a big
brown pitcher.</p>
<p>Two little girls worked at each
of the tables. While one filled
the bowls, the other brought the
bread.</p>
<p>She put two thick slices of bread
and a big cookie on each plate.</p>
<p>The young woman who had
let Clematis in, came to the table
near the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a new girl at your
table tonight, Jane,&#8221; she said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
&#8220;She will sit next to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Miss Rose,&#8221; answered
Jane, carefully filling the
last yellow bowl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please may I ring the bell
tonight, Miss Rose?&#8221; asked Sally,
who had been helping Jane.</p>
<p>Miss Rose looked at the table.
Every slice of bread and every
cookie was in place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear; your work is well
done. You may ring.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the sound of the supper
bell, a tramping of many feet
sounded in the long hall.</p>
<p>The doors of the dining room
were opened, and Mrs. Snow came
in, followed by a double line of
little girls.</p>
<p>Each girl knew just where to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
find her place, and stood waiting
for the signal to sit.</p>
<p>A teacher stood at the head of
each table, and beside Miss Rose
was the little stranger.</p>
<p>Mrs. Snow was the housemother.
She asked the blessing,
while every little girl bowed her
head.</p>
<p>Clematis stared about at the
other children all this time, and
wondered what they were doing.</p>
<p>Now they were seated, and
each girl buttoned her bib in
place before she tasted her supper.</p>
<p>Sally sat next to Clematis.</p>
<p>&#8220;They gave you a bath, didn&#8217;t
they?&#8221; she said, as she put her
bread into her bowl.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>Clematis nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you got a nice clean
apron like ours, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis nodded again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, see her hair, it&#8217;s lovely!&#8221;
sighed a little girl across the table,
who had short, straight hair.</p>
<p>Clematis&#8217; soft brown curls were
neatly brushed, and tied with a
dark red ribbon.</p>
<p>She did not look much like the
child who came in an hour before.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s her name?&#8221; asked
Jane, looking at Miss Rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll ask her tomorrow.
Now stop talking please, so she
can eat her supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that, the little girl looked
up at Miss Rose and said: &#8220;My
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
name is Clematis, and my kitty&#8217;s
name is Deborah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just as she said this, a very
strange noise was heard. Every
child stopped eating. Miss Rose
turned red, and Mrs. Snow looked
up in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miew, miew, miew,&#8221; came
from under the table. In another
minute a little head peeped over
the edge of the table where
Clematis sat. It was a kitten,
with a black spot over one eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miew, miew,&#8221; Deborah continued,
and stuck her little red
tongue right into the yellow bowl.
She was very hungry, and could
wait no longer.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i13.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 301px; height: 460px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 301px;'>
Deborah was very hungry<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>Mrs. Snow rapped on the table,
for every child laughed right out.
What fun it was! No one had
ever seen a cat in there before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Rose, will you kindly
put that cat out. Put her out
the front door.&#8221; Mrs. Snow was
very stern. She didn&#8217;t wish any
cats in the Home.</p>
<p>Clematis looked at Mrs. Snow.
Her eyes filled with tears, and she
began to sob.</p>
<p>Miss Rose turned as red as
Deborah&#8217;s tongue. She had not
asked Mrs. Snow if she might
let the cat in. She thought it
would stay in the kitchen with
Katie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear me, Miss Rose?
I wish you would please put the
cat out the door. We can&#8217;t have
it here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>Miss Rose started to get up,
when Clematis slipped out of her
chair, hugging Deborah tightly to
her breast.</p>
<p>The tears were running down
her cheeks, as she started for the
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going, little
girl?&#8221; said Mrs. Snow.</p>
<p>Clematis did not answer, but
kept right on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop her, Miss Rose. What
is the matter, anyway? Dear me,
what a fuss!&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rose caught Clematis by
the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, dear,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
act like that. Answer Mrs. Snow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; sobbed Clematis,
looking back. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
to stay here if you are going to
throw my cat away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have asked you, Mrs.
Snow,&#8221; said Miss Rose. &#8220;She
had the kitten with her. She
cried to bring it in, and Katie
said she would care for it in the
kitchen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, so that is it. Well, don&#8217;t
cry, child. Take it back to Katie,
and tell her to keep the door shut.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s hungry,&#8221; said Clematis,
drying her eyes on her sleeve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, ask Katie to feed her
then, and come right back to the
table.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE FIRST NIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p>Supper was soon finished, with
many giggles from the little girls,
who hoped that Deborah would
get in again.</p>
<p>Clematis ate every crumb of
her bread and cookie. Her yellow
bowl looked as if Deborah had
lapped it dry.</p>
<p>&#8220;After supper, we play games.
It&#8217;s great fun,&#8221; said Sally, as they
were folding their bibs.</p>
<p>The bell rang, and the long
line of children formed once
more.</p>
<p>They marched out through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
long hall, up the broad stairs to
the play room.</p>
<p>There were little tables, with
low chairs to match. Some of the
tables held games.</p>
<p>In one corner of the room was
a great doll house, that a rich lady
had given to the Home.</p>
<p>In another corner was a small
wooden swing with two seats.</p>
<p>A rocking horse stood near the
window, and a box of bean bags
lay on a low shelf near by.</p>
<p>Soon all were playing happily,
except Clematis, who stood near
the window.</p>
<p>She was looking at the trees,
which were sending out red buds.
The sun had set, and the sky was
rosy with the last light of day.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to play?&#8221;
asked Miss Rose, coming across
the room.</p>
<p>Clematis shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you like to do,
dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis thought a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to help Katie in
the kitchen. She must need some
little girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rose smiled. &#8220;If Clematis
can get down into the kitchen,
she can see her kitten,&#8221; she
thought. &#8220;She is a sly little puss
herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you could go
down tonight, but if you are a
good girl I am sure Katie will
want you to help her before
long.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>Clematis smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come now, and I will ask
Jane to show you the doll house.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the little girls took Clematis
over to the doll house that stood
in the corner.</p>
<p>Jane opened the front door, so
they could look in and see four
pretty rooms.</p>
<p>Lace curtains hung at the tiny
windows. New rugs were on the
floors.</p>
<p>There was a tiny kitchen, with
a tiny stove and tiny kettles,
all just like your own house. It
was enough to make any girl
happy.</p>
<p>It was so much fun that Clematis
forgot to be sad, and was
not ready to leave the doll house
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
when the bell rang once more.
It was bedtime.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the sleepy bell,&#8221; said
Jane, closing the door to the doll
house, and running toward the
stairs.</p>
<p>Clematis was at the end of
the row, as the girls went out of
the playroom, and Miss Rose spoke
as she passed through the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will show you where you
are to sleep, my dear. You go
with the other children, and I&#8217;ll
come in a few minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis followed the other
children up the stairs to the sleeping
rooms.</p>
<p>Miss Rose soon came, and together
they went to the room at
the end of the hall.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>How sweet that room looked
to the tired little stranger!</p>
<p>A white iron bed stood against
the wall, near the window. A
small table held a wash basin and
pitcher. There was a cup and
soap dish, too.</p>
<p>Two clean towels hung near by.</p>
<p>Best of all was the little white
bureau, with a mirror. The mirror
had a white frame.</p>
<p>There was a pink rug before
the bureau, and beside the bureau
was a white chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my!&#8221; cried Clematis, &#8220;see
the flowers on the wall!&#8221; The
pink wall paper was covered with
white roses and their green
leaves.</p>
<p>Miss Rose took a white nightdress
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
from the bureau, and laid it
on the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Clematis, I shall give
you just ten minutes to undress.
When I come back I want you to
be all ready for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rose went out, and Clematis
started on her shoes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess she don&#8217;t know how fast
I can undress,&#8221; she said to herself.</p>
<p>When Miss Rose came back,
in ten minutes, she found Clematis
already in bed, and half asleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why Clematis, this will never
do!&#8221; Miss Rose pulled back the
sheet and made Clematis sit up.</p>
<p>There, beside the bed, was a
pile of clothes. There were the
stockings, just as she had pulled
them off.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>The boots were thrown down
on the clean gingham dress, and
the fresh apron was sadly crushed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry, little girl,&#8221; said
Miss Rose, &#8220;but you will have to
get right up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Clematis.</p>
<p>&#8220;No little girl can go to bed
without washing her face and
hands. No little girl can leave
her clothes like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this my room?&#8221; said
Clematis, slowly getting out of bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is for tonight. We always
let a new child sleep alone the
first night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t I quick in getting into
bed? Why must I get up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, dear. Look at that
pile of clothes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I always leave them
there,&#8221; replied Clematis. &#8220;Then
I know just where to find them
in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t do so here, Clematis.
Now please pick up the clothes, fold
them, and put them on the chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then put your boots under
the chair, and take off your pretty
hair ribbon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis gathered the clothes
together, but she was not happy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you are tired, dear,
but I am tired too, and we must
do things right, even if we are
tired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I must show you how to
wash, and brush your teeth, and
then have you say your prayers,
before I can leave you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh bother!&#8221; sighed Clematis.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we mustn&#8217;t say words like
that. Come now, we will get
washed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rose poured some water
from the pitcher, and made Clematis
wash her hands, and arms, and
face, carefully. Then she took a
toothbrush from a box and gave
it to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this for?&#8221; asked
Clematis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why dear,&#8221; answered Miss
Rose in surprise, &#8220;that is a tooth
brush.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A tooth brush! Why, there
is no hair on my teeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rose laughed. &#8220;No dear,
perhaps not, but we must brush
them carefully each night with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
water, or they will soon be
aching.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will that stop teeth from
aching?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes indeed, it will help very
much to keep them from aching.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then.&#8221; Clematis
began to brush her teeth. &#8220;My
teeth ached last week. I nearly
died,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>The teeth were cleaned, and
Clematis was ready for bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now dear, let us say our
prayers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know any prayers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rose looked at Clematis
in pity. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you really know
any prayers at all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you know any prayers
if you had never learned any?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>Miss Rose smiled sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we
will learn the Lord&#8217;s Prayer, and
then you will know the most
beautiful prayer of all.&#8221;</p>
<p>They knelt down together, and
Clematis said over the words after
Miss Rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now good night, dear, and
pleasant dreams,&#8221; said Miss Rose,
as she tucked her in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night,&#8221; said Clematis.</p>
<p>The door closed, and all was
dark.</p>
<p>The maple trees swayed gently
outside the window.</p>
<p>They nodded to Clematis, as
she watched them with sleepy eyes.</p>
<p>One little star peeped in at her
through the maple tree.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>WHO IS CLEMATIS?</h3>
</div>

<p>The bright sun was shining on
the red buds of the maple tree
when Clematis woke the next
morning.</p>
<p>It was early. The rising bell had
not rung. Clematis got up and
looked out of the open window.</p>
<p>She could see nothing but
houses across the street, but the
buds of the maple were beautiful
in the sun.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had some of those
buds to put in my room,&#8221; said
Clematis to herself.</p>
<p>She took her clothes, and began
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
to dress. While she was dressing,
she looked again at the maple buds,
and wanted them more than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I reached out a little way,
I could get some of those, I just
know I could,&#8221; she thought.</p>
<p>As soon as she got her shoes on
she pushed the window wide open.</p>
<p>She leaned out. Some beautiful
buds were very near, but she
could not quite reach them.</p>
<p>She leaned out a little farther.
Then she climbed upon the window
sill.</p>
<p>They were still out of her reach.</p>
<p>For a minute she stopped. Then
she put one foot out in the
gutter. With one hand she held
the blind, and reached out to the
nearest branch.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>At last she had it. She drew
it nearer, and broke off a piece
with many buds.</p>
<p>As the piece broke off, the
branch flew back again to its place,
and Clematis almost fell back
through the window to the floor.</p>
<p>She patted the red buds and
made a little bunch of them. She
filled her cup with water and put
the buds in it; then she put it on
the bureau.</p>
<p>Clematis was looking proudly
at them, when the door opened,
and Miss Rose came in.</p>
<p>She looked at Clematis, and
then at the buds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Clematis!&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Then she looked out the window.
There, several feet beyond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
the window, was the broken end.
Drops of sap were running from
the white wood.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you get those buds?&#8221;
asked Miss Rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reached out of the window,&#8221;
said Clematis, &#8220;why, was that
stealing?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rose gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clematis, do you mean to tell
me that you climbed out of the window
and reached for that branch?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis nodded. Tears came
into her eyes. She must have
done something very wrong, but
she did not know just what was
so wicked about taking a small
branch from a maple tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know it was stealing,&#8221;
she sobbed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that, Clematis. It is
not wrong to take a twig, but
think of the danger. Don&#8217;t you
know you might have fallen and
killed yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis wiped her eyes on her
sleeve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s nothing,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;I had hold of the blind all the
time. I couldn&#8217;t fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Clematis, no child ever
did such a thing before, and you
must never, never, do it again.
Do you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you promise?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, let&#8217;s get ready for
breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis washed her face and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
hands, brushed her hair, and
cleaned her teeth carefully.</p>
<p>Soon she was ready to go down
stairs, and took one of the maple
buds to put in her dress.</p>
<p>As they went out, Miss Rose
saw that she wanted to say something.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want something?&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I help Katie this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After breakfast I will ask
Mrs. Snow, but breakfast is
almost ready now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then the breakfast bell
rang, and Clematis marched in
with the other children. She was
thinking about Deborah, and wondering
if she had caught any rats.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>For breakfast they had baked
apples, oatmeal with milk, and
rye gems.</p>
<p>It did not take them long
to eat this. Soon they were
through, and ready for the morning
work.</p>
<p>As they were getting up, Mrs.
Snow came to speak to Miss Rose.</p>
<p>Clematis held her breath when
she heard what was said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps this little girl would
like to go down and play with
her kitten a while. We can find
some work for her by and by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; said Clematis, &#8220;I
would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you can tell Katie I
said you might. Be sure not to
get in her way.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>Off ran Clematis to the kitchen,
to find her dear Deborah.</p>
<p>There she was, curled up like a
little ball under the stove.</p>
<p>She looked with sleepy eyes at
Clematis, and crawled down into
her lap.</p>
<p>Then Clematis smoothed her
and patted her, till she purred her
very sweetest purr.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Katie. &#8220;It&#8217;s a fine
cat. It caught a big rat in the
night, and brought it in, as proud
as pie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think they will let me
keep her?&#8221; asked Clematis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess so. If she catches
the rats, she will be welcome here.
You can be sure of that. I hate
rats.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>While Clematis and Deborah
were having such a good time in
the kitchen, Mrs. Snow took Miss
Rose to her room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Miss Rose, have you
found out anything about that
strange little child?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very much yet. She
talks very little, and has had very
little care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the poor child didn&#8217;t
know what a tooth brush was for.
She said she always left her clothes
in a pile by the bed, because she
could find them all in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Snow sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me, she will need much
care, to teach her how to do things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
well. But I guess her folks will
come for her before long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who her folks
can be. She has never learned
any prayers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor child, she must be a sad
case.&#8221; Mrs. Snow sighed again.</p>
<p>&#8220;But she is very fearless. This
morning, before I went to her
room, she had climbed out of the
window and broken off a piece
of the maple tree with buds on
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What, way up there at the
roof?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she said that was nothing,
for she had hold of the blind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did she want the branch
for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She wanted it for the red
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
buds. She broke them off and
put them in her cup, like flowers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Miss Rose, take her
out to walk this afternoon, and
ask her some questions. Perhaps
you can find out where she lives.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>CLEMATIS BEGINS TO LEARN</h3>
</div>

<p>Clematis played with Deborah
all the morning. She forgot
about helping Katie, and when
Katie asked her if she wanted
to help her peel some potatoes,
she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how.&#8221;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i14.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 292px; height: 460px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 292px;'>
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you ever peel potatoes?&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you ever peel potatoes?&#8221;
asked Katie.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I never had to do any
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you will have to be
doing some work round here. It&#8217;s
lucky for you that Mrs. Snow is
good to little girls. You would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
have a hard row to hoe in some
homes, believe me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis was busy tying her
hair ribbon round Deborah&#8217;s neck,
and did not answer.</p>
<p>The morning went fast, and
the dinner was ready before Clematis
was ready to leave her kitten.</p>
<p>For dinner they had soup, in
the little yellow bowls, with a big
piece of Johnny cake, and some
ginger bread.</p>
<p>As soon as dinner was over,
Miss Rose brought Clematis a
brown coat.</p>
<p>It was not new, but it was
neat and warm, much better than
the one she had worn the day
before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Clematis,&#8221; she said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
&#8220;I am going out to walk. Don&#8217;t
you want to go with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; asked
Clematis, shrinking back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, out in the park, and
down by the river. I think you
will like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis put on the coat as
quickly as she could. Then she
took Miss Rose by the hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s go,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might wait till I get my
coat and hat on.&#8221; Miss Rose was
laughing at her.</p>
<p>Soon they were down by the
river. Miss Rose sat on the
gravel, while Clematis ran along
the edge of the water.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>She sailed bits of wood for
boats, and threw little stones in,
to see the rings they made. She
was very, very happy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clematis,&#8221; said Miss Rose,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you remember the street
you lived on?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis thought a minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;How would you know the
street you lived on if nobody ever
told you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rose thought a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember your
mother&#8217;s name?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember. It was a
long time ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean she died a long
time ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rose asked her some
other questions. At last she
said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, tell me the name of the
man you lived with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His name was Smith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh dear, there are so many
Smiths, we shall never guess the
right one. Dear me, Clematis.
I don&#8217;t know how we shall ever
find your home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis threw a big stone into
the water, which made a big
splash.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you never will,&#8221; she
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Clematis! Do you mean
that you wish never to go back
where you came from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how would you like to
live in a place where you had to
stay in an old brick yard all day,
and never saw even grass?&#8221;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

Thinking of the land of flowers<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></div>
<p>Miss Rose thought a while.
Then she got up and started back
to the Home.</p>
<p>Clematis followed her slowly.
She was sorry to go.</p>
<p>That night Mrs. Snow talked
with Miss Rose again.</p>
<p>&#8220;She must have lived in the
city,&#8221; said Miss Rose. &#8220;She had
to stay in a yard paved with
bricks all day. She doesn&#8217;t remember
her parents at all. She ran
away, that is sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly know what to do,&#8221;
said Mrs. Snow, at last. &#8220;She
can stay here for a while, and
perhaps the people she lived with
will find her here.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Mrs. Snow told the policeman
what they had found out,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
and he said they would do the
best they could to find her people.</p>
<p>That night Clematis did not go
to the little room near the maple
tree to sleep. She went into the
big room.</p>
<p>Jane slept in the bed next to
hers. Miss Rose told her to see
that Clematis had what help she
needed in going to bed.</p>
<p>The day had been a busy one
for Clematis. She was very
sleepy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I won&#8217;t bother with
teeth and things tonight,&#8221; she
said to herself.</p>
<p>So she pulled off her clothes,
and got into bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh Clematis, you can&#8217;t do
that. You&#8217;ve got to pick up your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
clothes, and clean your teeth, and
do lots of things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane came and shook her, as
she snuggled under the clothes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m too tired tonight.
I&#8217;ll do it tomorrow night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis did not stir.</p>
<p>Just then Miss Rose came into
the sleeping room.</p>
<p>She saw Jane trying to get
Clematis out of bed. She also
saw the pile of clothes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clematis, I can&#8217;t have this.
Get right out of bed, and do as I
told you last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>She wanted children to obey
her, and she had tried to be very
kind to Clematis.</p>
<p>The other children giggled, as
Clematis got slowly out of bed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>But Miss Rose frowned at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see that she does every
single thing she ought,&#8221; said Miss
Rose to Jane, &#8220;and if she doesn&#8217;t,
you tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Miss Rose went away,
and left the girls to get ready for
bed.</p>
<p>Poor Clematis had a hard time
of it. The other girls made fun
of her, because she was so clumsy
and slow. At last she got her
clothes folded up, and went to
wash.</p>
<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t washing her neck
and ears,&#8221; said Jane to herself,
&#8220;but I guess I won&#8217;t tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>So at last Clematis got into bed
again, and went to sleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>CLEMATIS HAS A HARD ROW TO HOE</h3>
</div>

<p>It was all Jane could do the
next morning to make Clematis
get up when the rising bell rang.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to get up yet,&#8221;
grumbled Clematis. &#8220;I will get
up pretty soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No you won&#8217;t either. You&#8217;ll
get up right off now. We have
to be ready for breakfast in fifteen
minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane pulled down the clothes,
while the other girls laughed.
Poor Clematis had to get up.</p>
<p>At first she was cross, but when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
she looked out of the window, she
smiled.</p>
<p>From this window she could see
way off to a beautiful hill, golden
brown in the morning sun.</p>
<p>Part way to the hill was a
river. Its little waves shimmered
and danced. Its shores were quite
green already.</p>
<p>Now Clematis was wide awake
and happy. She started to dress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wash first,&#8221; said Jane.</p>
<p>Clematis started to grumble
again, but when she looked into
the mirror above the wash stand,
there was the river, smiling at her
in the mirror.</p>
<p>She knew this river. She had
been there. Perhaps she would
go again some day.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>For breakfast they had a bowl
of oatmeal and milk, with two
slices of bread.</p>
<p>Clematis looked around while
they were eating.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you ever get a cup of
coffee for breakfast?&#8221; she asked
of Sally, who sat next to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, never, but sometimes
we have cocoa, on real cold mornings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis turned up her nose a
little. She did not care much for
oatmeal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like doughnuts and coffee a
great deal better,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh, you won&#8217;t have any
doughnuts and coffee round here,&#8221;
said Jane. &#8220;You&#8217;d better eat
what you have.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>Clematis took her advice, and
had just finished her bread, when
the bell sounded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Clematis,&#8221; said Miss
Rose, &#8220;you are going to stay
here for a while anyway, so you
must take your part in the daily
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you said yesterday you
would like to help Katie in the
kitchen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&#8217;m,&#8221; said Clematis.
She had been thinking of Deborah
and longing to see her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s go down and see
what Katie can find for you to
do.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was Deborah, sleeping
under the edge of the stove.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
Clematis took her while Miss Rose
was asking Katie.</p>
<p>&#8220;This little girl thinks she
would like to have some work
down here in the kitchen, Katie.
Is there anything you would like
her to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, no thank you, Miss
Rose, she wouldn&#8217;t be any use at
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis looked up. She did
not feel very happy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, don&#8217;t you think she
could help you?&#8221; Miss Rose
looked surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;No miss, she is no use at all.
Yesterday I asked her to peel
some potatoes, but she never
lifted a finger. She said she
didn&#8217;t know how.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Clematis, I am surprised.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Clematis, &#8220;if you
never learned to peel potatoes,
would you know how to do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think I should. Katie
would have shown you, if you
had been willing to try.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis hung her head, and
buried her face in Deborah&#8217;s soft
fur.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, miss, she&#8217;s of no use
to me. She don&#8217;t want to work
at all. Her cat, now, is a worker.
She caught a big rat in the
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, Clematis, we shall
have to ask Mrs. Snow to find
you something else to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis dropped her kitten,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
and the tears ran down her
cheeks, as she followed Miss Rose
upstairs.</p>
<p>Katie looked after her with a
sad smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll have a hard row to hoe
round here, believe me,&#8221; she said
to herself.</p>
<p>Mrs. Snow frowned when Miss
Rose told her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very sorry,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;She may work with Jane, then,
in the dormitory. Jane is a good
worker and can teach her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor Clematis was rather
frightened when she heard that
she was to work in the dormitory.
She was afraid a dormitory was
some dark place like a prison.
She did not know that the dormitory
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
was the big room where
she had slept.</p>
<p>Soon Clematis was back in the
big room again. There she took the
place of another little girl, who
was making up the beds with Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry up now,&#8221; said Jane.
&#8220;We have got to get these beds
all made up before nine o&#8217;clock.
School begins then.&#8221;</p>
<p>She showed Clematis how to
tuck the sheet in, down at the
foot, and pull it up smooth at
the head of the bed.</p>
<p>Clematis was looking out of
the window, way over the river,
to the sunny brown hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;There now. Why don&#8217;t you
look out?&#8221; said Jane. For Clematis
had given such a pull that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
she pulled all the clothes out at
the foot of the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was looking out, so there,&#8221;
said Clematis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, looking out of the window,
that&#8217;s all.&#8221; Jane was vexed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now hurry up and get them
tucked in again.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Clematis was very clumsy,
and not very willing. She had
never had to make beds before.
She didn&#8217;t see any need of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t you leave the
blankets till you go to bed, and
then just pull them up?&#8221; she said,
pouting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you can&#8217;t, that&#8217;s why.
And you&#8217;d better try, or you&#8217;ll
never get a chance to go to the
country.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean? Who
goes to the country?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis came round the bed
and took Jane by the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, most of the children
who do well, or try hard to do
well, go to the country for two
weeks in the summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the country where the
flowers grow, and where there is
grass all around?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, and where they give you
milk and apple pie. Oh, apple
pie even for breakfast, and doughnuts
between meals. I had doughnuts
every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Crickety!&#8221; said Clematis.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better not let Miss Rose
hear you say that, and you needn&#8217;t
worry. You won&#8217;t go to any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
country, when you can&#8217;t even
make beds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis gave Jane a frightened
look, and started to work the best
she knew how.</p>
<p>But the best Clematis knew
how was very poor work, and by
the time the bell rang for school,
one bed still had to be done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let it alone,&#8221; said Jane. &#8220;I
can make it up faster myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her hands and feet moved fast
enough to surprise little Clematis,
who followed her friend down to
the school room, wondering how
long it would take her to learn to
make beds.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>WHAT CLEMATIS FOUND</h3>
</div>

<p>School began with music, and
Miss Rose went to the piano.
The minute she began to play,
Clematis stood up, and stared at
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down. Don&#8217;t stand up
now.&#8221; Jane pulled her sleeve.</p>
<p>But Clematis paid no attention.
She kept her eyes on the piano,
and seemed to hear nothing else.</p>
<p>The song was of Spring; of
birds, and brooks, and flowers.
Clematis listened to every word,
and when it was finished she sat
down with a sigh.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>After the singing, they had a
class in reading.</p>
<p>Clematis stared at the words
on the blackboard, but could not
tell any of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you learned any of your
letters?&#8221; asked Miss Rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m,&#8221; said Clematis.</p>
<p>The other children giggled, for
Clematis was as large as Jane.
Jane was eight, and could read
very well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tomorrow you must go into
the special class, and you must
work hard, and catch up as fast
as you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis was angry. She didn&#8217;t
like to be laughed at.</p>
<p>At recess, all the children ran
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
out into the yard to play. It was
a large yard, with a high wooden
fence around it.</p>
<p>Glad to be free, Jane ran off to
find some chums, and left Clematis
to play by herself.</p>
<p>So Clematis wandered round by
the fence till she came to a sunny
spot, near the big maple tree with
the red buds.</p>
<p>Here she picked up a dead twig
and sat down, turning over the
dried leaves with the twig, and
throwing them in the air.</p>
<p>As she picked up the leaves,
she saw some blades of grass
beneath them.</p>
<p>Then she picked up more leaves,
and found many blades of grass
growing beneath their warm shelter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>Clematis got up and walked
near the fence, where the leaves
were thicker. There she poked
them away, and found longer
blades of grass, and new leaves,
green and shiny.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said to herself, &#8220;I
hope I can come out here every
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she stopped. She pushed
away some more leaves. She
looked around at the other children.</p>
<p>None of them were looking at
her.</p>
<p>She stooped, and took something
from under the pile of leaves.</p>
<p>Again she looked about, but
nobody was paying attention to
her. All the children were playing
games.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>Then a sound made her look
up. It was the bell. Recess was
over, and all the children were
going in.</p>
<p>Clematis put her hand into her
apron pocket quickly, and followed
the other children back to
school.</p>
<p>&#8220;How has the new girl done
today?&#8221; asked Mrs. Snow, just
before they sat down to dinner.</p>
<p>&#8220;She seems to feel more at
home,&#8221; replied Miss Rose. &#8220;She
doesn&#8217;t know her letters yet. I
guess she has grown up all by
herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is too bad. I will give her
a test this afternoon, about three.
If she would like to play with
her kitten in the playroom for an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
hour, after dinner, she may do
so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am sure she would be
glad to see her kitten. She is a
queer child. At recess she stole
away all by herself, to play by
the fence.&#8221;</p>
<p>The children were coming in
now, and Mrs. Snow nodded to
Miss Rose, as she went to her
chair.</p>
<p>Little Sally had been just behind
Miss Rose as she said the
last words to Mrs. Snow. She
heard part of the words she said,
and began to whisper to her
neighbor.</p>
<p>&#8220;She said somebody stole something.
It must be that new girl.
See how queer she looks.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>Then of course the neighbor had
to whisper to the girl next to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what it was the
new girl stole? See how funny
she looks. She&#8217;d better not steal
anything of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a minute Clematis knew
they were talking about her. She
didn&#8217;t know what it was, but she
knew it was unkind.</p>
<p>They were looking at her, and
talking to each other. Her face
turned red. She could not eat.
One hand went deep into her apron
pocket.</p>
<p>Miss Rose quickly saw that
something was wrong. She knew
that little girls often made fun of
the strangers, and it vexed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any little girl who is not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
polite,&#8221; she said, &#8220;may leave the
table at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls stopped talking, but
they poked each other with their
feet under the table. They were
sure Clematis had stolen something,
for she looked just as if
she had.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Clematis, eat your
dinner now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; said Clematis. But
it was hard to swallow the bread.</p>
<p>She drank the soup, and left
most of the bread by her bowl.</p>
<p>As soon as the bell rang, Miss
Rose beckoned to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to take Deborah
to the playroom for a while,
and play with her there?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis looked very much surprised.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
She had expected some
new trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&#8217;m,&#8221; she gasped, and
started down to the kitchen, glad
to get away from the other girls,
who had been watching.</p>
<p>Then Miss Rose beckoned to
Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane, what were the girls
saying about Clematis at the
table?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane hung her head. She did
not like to repeat such awful
things about Clematis, for she
really liked her, though it was
hard to teach her to work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, Jane. Miss Rose
wants to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The girls were saying she
stole something.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Stole something? Why, what
did she steal, Jane?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I just heard
them saying she had stolen something.
She looked just as if she
had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Thank you, Jane.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane went down to the school
room, where all the girls were
eager to know what Clematis had
stolen. But Jane could tell them
nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;She just asked me what you
said,&#8221; Jane declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just like Jane,&#8221; cried
Sally. &#8220;She knows all the time,
only she won&#8217;t tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>While they were talking, Clematis
was finding a cosy corner in
the playroom, and smoothing out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
every hair on Deborah&#8217;s smooth
back.</p>
<p>Deborah seemed very happy,
and purred all the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care if they do say
mean things, and make noses at
me. You won&#8217;t ever, will you,
Debby?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Purr, purr, purr,&#8221; said Deborah.
No indeed, she never would.</p>
<p>Time went fast, and it was
three o&#8217;clock before Clematis had
got Deborah settled down for
sleep in a little bed she made for
her beneath the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take her downstairs now,
Clematis,&#8221; said Miss Rose, coming
in. &#8220;Then come up to Mrs.
Snow&#8217;s room. We want to ask
you some questions.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>Again Clematis turned red.
She went slowly downstairs, with
Deborah under one arm. The
other hand deep in her apron
pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;She surely looks as if something
were wrong,&#8221; thought Miss
Rose, as Clematis disappeared.</p>
<p>Clematis looked very unhappy
when she went to Mrs. Snow&#8217;s
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, little girl,&#8221; said
Mrs. Snow, kindly. &#8220;There are
some things I want to ask you
about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; replied Clematis, her
lips quivering.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, I want to know what
all this talk is about. Some of
the girls were saying that you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
took something which did not
belong to you. Can that be
true?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis hung her head. The
tears came into her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry, Clematis,&#8221; said
Miss Rose. &#8220;Just tell Mrs. Snow
what it is, and perhaps we can
make it all right again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was it, little girl?&#8221;
asked Mrs. Snow, as she drew
her nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was mine, I found it first,&#8221;
sobbed Clematis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but you must remember
that if we find a thing, that does
not make it ours. We must find
the true owner, and give it back.
That is the only honest thing to
do.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What was it you found?&#8221;
asked Miss Rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t kn-ow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you find it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do-wn by the fe-ence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is it now, Clematis?&#8221;
Mrs. Snow spoke kindly, as she
wiped the child&#8217;s face with her
handkerchief.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s in my pocket,&#8221; answered
Clematis.</p>
<p>She drew out her closed hand,
held it before the two ladies, and
slowly opened it.</p>
<p>Within lay a limp, withered
dandelion blossom.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>A VISITOR</h3>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Snow still tells the story
of how Clematis stole the first
dandelion of the springtime, out
under the leaves.</p>
<p>People laugh when they hear
the story. You see, it all came
about because the children told
tales on each other, and it was
a good joke on them.</p>
<p>But as Clematis stood there, before
Mrs. Snow and Miss Rose, she
didn&#8217;t see the joke at all. She cried,
and hid her face in her arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here, dear,&#8221; said Mrs.
Snow. &#8220;It is all right, and you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
shall have every dandelion you
find in the yard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it stealing?&#8221; sobbed
Clematis.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it was all right, if you
found it first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And can I have all I find
first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis lifted her head, and
wiped the tears from her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, and seemed
happy once more. She smoothed
the limp little flower in her hot
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Mrs. Snow,
&#8220;I wonder if you can tell us some
more about yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m, I&#8217;ll tell you all you
ask, and I won&#8217;t tell any lies.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you won&#8217;t. Perhaps
you can remember, now, where
you lived before you came here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis shook her head. &#8220;I told
Miss Rose every single thing,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;except&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Except what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Except that I ran away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis hung her head again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you run away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, wouldn&#8217;t you run away,
if you had to stay in a yard all
day that was nothing but bricks?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Snow smiled. &#8220;Perhaps
I would,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you ever go out at
all?&#8221; asked Miss Rose, who had
been listening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just sometimes, to go over to
the store. Just across the street
and back, and that was all bricks,
too.&#8221;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i05.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 305px; height: 459px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 305px;'>
Clematis held out her hand<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you could find
your way home again, if Miss
Rose went with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis shook her head. &#8220;Oh,
no. It was a long, long way. I
was most dead from walking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Snow thought a moment.
Then she said, &#8220;Miss Rose tells
me that you have not learned to
read. Is that true?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m, I never learned to do
anything except count the change
I got. But I can learn to read,
and do numbers, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis spoke without sobbing
now. She was thinking of the
country, where girls went who
did well.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you could take
her in a class by herself for a
short time?&#8221; Mrs. Snow asked,
turning to Miss Rose.</p>
<p>Miss Rose was about to answer,
when one of the older girls came
to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Ruth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, Mrs. Snow, a man
wants to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is his name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His name is Smith. He
wants to see you about a little
girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she said this, Miss Rose
looked up quickly.</p>
<p>Clematis also looked up. Her
face turned red, and she put a
finger in her mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him to come in here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>In another minute a small,
thin man walked in.</p>
<p>He was poorly dressed, and
looked as if he had been ill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you wish to see me about
one of the children?&#8221; asked Mrs.
Snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, marm, about this little
girl right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man turned and smiled at
Clematis, who was standing close
by Miss Rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Clematis, I thought I
should find you somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis smiled too, but she
did not speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Mrs. Snow, &#8220;are
you the one who took care of this
little girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, marm. I&#8217;ve had her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
ever since she was a little
baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Snow thought a minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you want to take
her home with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that. I
have no home to keep a child in,
and do right by her. You see, my
wife is sick most of the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know any of her
folks who could care for her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, marm. Her mother came
to our house when Clematis was
a tiny baby. She said the father
was dead. Then she died too,
and we could never find out who
she was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know her last name?&#8221;
asked Miss Rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, miss. We never knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
her last name. She said it was
Jones, but we never believed that
was the truth. This little girl we
just called Clematis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t she have anything to
help you find out who she was?&#8221;
asked Mrs. Snow in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a single thing, except this
picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man took out a small
photograph.</p>
<p>It showed three girls standing
together in front of a brick building.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is her mother on the
left, marm, but I don&#8217;t see how
the picture helps very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true. Still, the picture
is better than nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is just what we thought,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
marm,&#8221; Mr. Smith replied. &#8220;We
kept her along, hoping we should
find some one to claim her, but no
one came. She is too big for us
to care for now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are ready to give
her up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, marm, if you will care
for her. She is very restless, and
always wanting to run off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Snow turned to Clematis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you would
rather stay here, than go back with
Mr. Smith?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; said Clematis,
quickly. She had been thinking
of the visits to the country. If
she went back to the yard, all
made of bricks, how would she
ever see the grass and flowers?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, Mr. Smith. I
think you have done a good deal
to keep her as long as you have.
She was well fed, even if she
didn&#8217;t learn much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, marm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Miss Rose took Clematis
out of the office, while Mrs. Snow
talked with Mr. Smith.</p>
<p>All the afternoon Clematis
wondered what they were going
to do with her.</p>
<p>After supper Miss Rose called
to her, as the children were going
to the playroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clematis,&#8221; she said, &#8220;do you
think that if you stayed here you
could work real hard, and learn to
do as the other children do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Mrs. Snow finds
that we can keep you here. I will
try to teach you myself, so you
can catch up with the other children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; said Clematis.</p>
<p>That is all she said, but she
was so glad, that she could not
sleep for a long time after she
went to bed.</p>
<p>She lay awake thinking, and
thinking, of the things she would
learn to do, so she might go at
last to the country, the land of
flowers, and grass, and birds; the
land where white clouds floated
always in a blue, blue sky.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE SECRET</h3>
</div>

<p>The next morning Clematis did
better in helping Jane with the
beds, and before many mornings
had passed she learned so well
that Miss Rose praised her for her
work.</p>
<p>When she wanted to stop trying,
and wanted to get up without
washing her face and hands, and
cleaning her teeth, she would look
out the window at the hill beyond
the river.</p>
<p>It seemed to smile at her and
say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget the beautiful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
country, little girl. Remember
the birds and the flowers. Do
the best you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there were so many things
to do that it seemed to poor
Clematis as if she would never
learn half of them.</p>
<p>When she tried to help in setting
the table, she dropped some
plates.</p>
<p>She said things that made the
other girls cross, for she had
never learned to play with other
girls, and she forgot that she
could no longer do just as she
pleased.</p>
<p>Worst of all, she did not always
pay attention to study, and when
Miss Rose left her to do some
numbers, would be looking out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
the window, instead of working
on her paper.</p>
<p>So the days went on, and spring
was almost over.</p>
<p>The dandelions had all blossomed
and grown up tall, with
white caps on their heads, and
there were no other flowers in
the yard.</p>
<p>One day Clematis found something
which made her almost as
happy as if she had found some
flowers.</p>
<p>At first she thought she would
keep it a secret, and tell no one
about it. Then she thought how
good Jane had been to her, so
she went up to her when she was
standing alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Jane, if I tell you a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
secret will you promise not to tell
anybody else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I&#8217;ll promise,&#8221; said Jane.
&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis looked around. The
other children were playing games.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come over here,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She led Jane to the big board
fence which stood at the back of
the yard.</p>
<p>Then she got down on her
knees and took hold of one of
the boards. It was loose, and she
could pull it out.</p>
<p>&#8220;See, look through there,&#8221; said
Clematis, in a low voice.</p>
<p>Her face shone with pleasure
as she peeped through.</p>
<p>Jane knelt down, and peeped
through too. Beyond the fence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
she could see into another
yard.</p>
<p>In this yard there was grass
growing, and flower-beds, where
the flowers were beginning to
grow up in green shoots.</p>
<p>But this was not all. Not far
from the fence, by a corner of
the garden, stood a low bush.
She could smell its sweet fragrance
from where she knelt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see it?&#8221; whispered
Clematis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I see it. I can
smell it too. It&#8217;s great.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane took in a long breath of
the fragrance, and smiled at
Clematis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I wish I had some of
those blossoms.&#8221; Clematis looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
eagerly at the blossoms. &#8220;Do
you know what they are, Jane?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; those are lilacs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two girls had just time to
take one more deep breath, full
of the fragrance from the lilac
blossoms, before the bell rang.</p>
<p>Jane kept her promise, and
while the lilacs lasted, they used
to go often to their secret place
and smell the fragrance of the
blossoms.</p>
<p>The first of July, some of the
girls began to start for their vacations
in the country.</p>
<p>Now it was harder than ever
for Clematis to stick to her work.
She kept thinking of the beautiful
fields, when she should have
been thinking of numbers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what we are
going to do with you, Clematis,&#8221;
said Miss Rose one day.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do try hard sometimes.
You have learned to make beds
well. You are a good girl about
your clothes, morning and night.
But you are dreaming of other
things, I fear. What is it you
dream about so much?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis thought a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think I will have a
chance to go to the country?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up at Miss Rose.
Her face was white and anxious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why Clematis. I don&#8217;t
know. You wouldn&#8217;t be very
much help I am afraid. You
quarrel with the other children,
and you are very slow to learn.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; said Clematis, and
hung her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; said Miss Rose, &#8220;you
might have a chance later. If
you try hard I will not forget
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis tried to feel happier
then, but there were so many
things to learn, and so few days
to learn them in, that she hardly
dared to hope very much.</p>
<p>She found it very hard to learn
to play happily with the other
children, and liked it much better
just to get Deborah all by herself
and play with her.</p>
<p>July went by, and the children
began to come back again. They
told stories of the wonderful
things they had seen, and now
Clematis was only too glad to sit
near them and listen.</p>

</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Sally, who had been
to Maine, &#8220;Mr. Lane had a field
almost as big as a whole city, full
of long grass and daisies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would he let you pick the
daisies?&#8221; asked Clematis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course he would; all you
wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Maine?&#8221; asked
Clematis, eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear her talk,&#8221; said another
girl, named Betty, with a sniff.
&#8220;She needn&#8217;t worry, she&#8217;ll never
get a chance to pick any.&#8221;</p>
<p>Betty was not very kind, and
did not like Clematis. She often
made fun of the younger children.</p>
<p>Clematis turned red. Her eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
flashed, and she was about to
answer, when the supper bell
rang.</p>
<p>They had just sat down at the
table, when Betty said to a girl
near by:</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to hear Clematis.
She thinks she is going to the
country. Just as if anybody would
have her around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Betty sat next to Clematis, who
heard every word.</p>
<p>She had tried to be a good girl
and learn, just as Miss Rose asked
her to.</p>
<p>Her face burned, and her eyes
flashed more than ever.</p>
<p>Before she stopped to think,
she turned and waved her spoon
before Betty&#8217;s face, saying:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t stop me. You&#8217;d
better keep quiet, you old pig!&#8221;</p>
<p>Betty was so startled that she
moved back. Her arm struck
her bowl of milk, and the milk
spilled out, all over the table.</p>
<p>Part of it spilled down into
her lap.</p>
<p>Then Clematis began to cry.
When Miss Rose sent her away
from the table, and up to her
bed, she went willingly.</p>
<p>She was glad to get away from
the other children.</p>
<p>Miss Rose saw how sad she
was, and knew how naughty
Betty had been, so she did not
punish her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very sorry you have
not learned to behave more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
politely, Clematis. Perhaps this
will be a lesson to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was all she said before
Clematis went to bed, but
Clematis cried quietly a long, long
time.</p>
<p>She felt that she had made
every one look at her, right in
front of Mrs. Snow. What
would Mrs. Snow think of her
now?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>TWO DOCTORS</h3>
</div>

<p>It was very late before
Clematis fell asleep that night,
and in the morning she had a
headache.</p>
<p>When she got up she had to
sit on the bed, she felt so dizzy.</p>
<p>Miss Rose found her sitting
there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Clematis,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Are you sick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m, I guess so,&#8221; whispered
the poor little girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lie right down again, dear,
and perhaps you will feel better.&#8221;</p>
<p>They brought her a cup of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
cocoa, and some toast, for
breakfast, but she could not eat.</p>
<p>All day she lay there, pale
and sick.</p>
<p>In the afternoon old Doctor
Field came in to see her. He
sat down by the bed and asked
her some questions.</p>
<p>He looked at her tongue, and
felt her pulse. Then he took out
some little pills and gave them to
Miss Rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you had better put
her in a single room,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Give her some of these in water,
every two hours during the day.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled at Clematis before
he went out. &#8220;I guess she will
feel better in the morning, when
I come again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>But in the morning Clematis
was not better. She was worse.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did she pass the night?&#8221;
asked Doctor Field, as he felt
her pulse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very well,&#8221; said Miss
Rose. &#8220;She did not sleep much,
and had a good deal of pain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Field looked at her
chest and arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be chicken pox, or
measles,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t
see any of the usual signs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Little Clematis lay and looked
at him steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you want something,
dear?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want a drink,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I want a drink of cold, cold
water.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear, you shall have a
drink, of course you shall.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old doctor went into the
hall with Miss Rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;She may have a drink, but
only a little at a time. And I
wouldn&#8217;t let it be too cold. She
really gets enough water with her
medicine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon they brought Clematis a
little water in a cup. She raised
her head and drank it, but then
made a face and turned her head
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t any good,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>That evening old Doctor Field
came again. He looked carefully
at Clematis, and shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s only a slow
fever. It&#8217;s nothing catching,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
said. &#8220;She&#8217;ll be better in a few
days.&#8221;</p>
<p>The few days passed, but
Clematis was not better.</p>
<p>At night she was restless, and
slept little. Even when she did
sleep, her slumber was disturbed
by bad dreams.</p>
<p>She talked to herself during
these dreams, though people
couldn&#8217;t understand what she said.</p>
<p>Doctor Field came to see her
every day or two, but he could
not tell what her sickness was.
He always said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Just give her the medicine as
directed, and she will be better
soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rose had asked Mrs. Snow
if she might take care of her, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
she had come to love little
Clematis, and Clematis loved her
in return.</p>
<p>The school work did not take
her time very much now, so
Mrs. Snow was glad to let
Miss Rose care for Clematis.</p>
<p>If she stayed away very long,
Clematis would call for her. She
wanted her in the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Snow,&#8221; said Miss Rose,
one day, after Clematis had been
ill more than two weeks, &#8220;I am
very anxious about Clematis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she no better?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I feel she is worse. She
keeps asking for a cold drink of
water, and says she is burning up.
I wish I dared give her some, and
keep her cooler.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think I should follow
the doctor&#8217;s directions. It wouldn&#8217;t
be wise to do anything that is
not directed by him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you suppose we could
have another doctor to look at
her, Mrs. Snow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I fear not; not just now,
anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rose went back to the
little room upstairs with a sad
heart. She knew Clematis was
very ill.</p>
<p>That night she prayed that
something might be done for the
little sick girl, and the next
morning she felt as if her prayers
had been answered, when Doctor
Field came.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall have to be away for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
short time, Miss Rose,&#8221; he said,
after he looked at Clematis, and
felt her pulse.</p>
<p>&#8220;A young man, Doctor Wyatt,
will take my place, and I am sure
he will do all that can be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can he come today?&#8221; asked
Miss Rose. &#8220;I wish he could see
her soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will ask him. I think he
will be much interested in Clematis.
I should like to see her
well again myself, but I must be
out of town a few weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope he will come
today, and I hope he will take an
interest in my little girl,&#8221; said
Miss Rose to herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know she can be cured, if we
only know what is the matter.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>That afternoon Doctor Wyatt
came. Miss Rose was glad
when she saw him, for he was
so kind, and so wise, that she
knew he would do the best he
could.</p>
<p>The afternoon was hot, and
Clematis was covered with hot
blankets, as directed by Doctor
Field.</p>
<p>Dr. Wyatt took the blankets,
and threw them off.</p>
<p>&#8220;The poor child will roast under
those,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Then he sat beside her, and
watched her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anything you would
like?&#8221; he said at last, in a pleasant
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I want a cold drink of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
water.&#8221; Her voice sounded faint
and feeble now.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does she have to
drink?&#8221; asked Doctor Wyatt.</p>
<p>&#8220;We give her water now and
then, as directed by Dr. Field.
But we do not give her very much,
and not very cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any oranges in the
house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could get some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then take the white of an
egg, and put with it the juice of a
whole orange. Add half a glass
of water, with pieces of ice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have good big pieces of ice,&#8221;
Doctor Wyatt called after her, as
he saw that Clematis had fixed her
eye on him.</p>
<p>Clematis smiled when he said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
that, and turned toward him with
a sigh.</p>
<p>Soon Miss Rose came back with
the glass. Dr. Wyatt held it to
the lips of the little sick girl. She
drank slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh thanks,&#8221; she whispered,
when he took the glass away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give her some of that
whenever she asks for it,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now tell me about the
nights,&#8221; the doctor went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is restless, and sleeps
very little. She has bad dreams
when she does sleep, and talks to
herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does she talk about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. We can&#8217;t
make out.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you keep the room lighted
at night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, it is kept dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, tonight keep it lighted.
People who have bad dreams are
often frightened by the dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I give her the medicine
as directed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t give her any more
medicine at present. Give her all
she wants of the orange and egg.
I&#8217;ll be back in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Dr. Wyatt was gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a good doctor,&#8221; said
Clematis, licking her dry lips. &#8220;I
want a drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rose smiled, and put the
glass to her lips.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>A LONG, ANXIOUS NIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Doctor Wyatt,
the next morning, &#8220;how is Clematis
today?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She seems a little more comfortable,&#8221;
said Miss Rose.</p>
<p>The doctor sat by her for half
an hour. He felt her pulse, and
looked her all over. Then he
shook his head.</p>
<p>That day he spent a long time
studying his books.</p>
<p>In the evening he came again,
and sat by Clematis. He shook
his head, sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must tell you, Miss Rose,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
that Clematis is a very sick little
girl,&#8221; he said, as they stood in
the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you do anything for
her?&#8221; The tears sprang to her
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I can. If she is no
better tomorrow, I shall feel very
anxious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again that night the doctor
spent a long time over his big
books. Then he went and talked
with doctors in the hospital.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be here most of the
time tonight,&#8221; he said the next
morning. &#8220;Keep her cool, and as
comfortable as you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rose went back to the
bed with aching heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if we only knew what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
was the matter with you, Clematis,&#8221;
she thought, as she looked
at the little white face.</p>
<p>In the evening Doctor Wyatt
came back once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Rose,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;you are very tired. You must
go away for a walk, or a visit, or
a rest. I will take care of her
tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think I had better
stay, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you must rest. Please
have a cup of coffee sent to me
about ten. I shall stay right
here. You will be needed tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Wyatt sat down to
watch by Clematis.</p>
<p>It was a warm evening, so he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
gave her a drink, and fanned her,
to cool her hot face.</p>
<p>As it grew late, she fell into a
light sleep. As she slept, she
began to talk in low tones.</p>
<p>The doctor bent his head down
very near her lips, and listened
carefully to everything she said.</p>
<p>Hour after hour he watched
and listened, until he, too, fell
asleep, just as the sun was coming
up.</p>
<p>Miss Rose found him there in
the morning, sleeping in his chair,
close by the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Rose,&#8221; he asked, as he
started up, &#8220;did this little girl want
anything very much indeed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she did. She wanted to
go to the country, as the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
children did, but it did not seem
quite possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it! That&#8217;s just it!&#8221;
exclaimed Doctor Wyatt. &#8220;She
spoke of flowers, of lilacs and
daisies. I couldn&#8217;t tell much
what she said, but I could hear
those words.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment, Clematis
opened her eyes and stared about
her.</p>
<p>Doctor Wyatt took one thin,
frail hand in his big brown ones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clematis,&#8221; he said in a loud,
firm tone, &#8220;I know a lovely place
in the country. If you will get
well, you can go there for two
whole weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis stared at him, but did
not seem to hear him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I want a drink,&#8221; she said
feebly.</p>
<p>He put the glass to her lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can pick daisies, and
goldenrod, and all sorts of flowers
in the country, if you&#8217;ll just get
well, can&#8217;t she, Miss Rose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Clematis, you can.&#8221;
Miss Rose tried to speak cheerfully,
but it was hard. She
wanted to cry.</p>
<p>Clematis stared at her also
for a minute, and then turned
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go get some sleep now.
Keep her cool and comfortable,
till I come back again this evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>The day passed slowly. Mrs.
Snow came in two or three times
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
to look at Clematis, and feel her
pulse.</p>
<p>Some of the other teachers
came to peep in also. They
went away softly, wiping their
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a queer little girl,&#8221;
said one, &#8220;but I do love her.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is what they all felt.</p>
<p>At evening Doctor Wyatt returned.
He looked anxious, as
he took his seat beside the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall stay till about ten,
Miss Rose, so you must rest now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go,&#8221; said
Miss Rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must, you will be needed
later. She will need great care
tonight, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>At ten, Miss Rose returned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
She had not rested much, and was
glad to get back to the bedside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is my telephone number,
Miss Rose. You can get me very
soon by calling me up. Watch
her carefully, and if you see any
change at all, send for me at
once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think there may be
a change tonight?&#8221; Miss Rose
looked straight into his face to
see just what he meant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Rose, there may
be, and I hope it will be for the
better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You hope?&#8221; Miss Rose held
her breath a minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, let us hope. Hope does
more than all the medicine in the
world.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>The minutes crept along into
hours, and midnight passed, while
Miss Rose watched.</p>
<p>Clematis seemed restless, but
she did not talk to herself any
more.</p>
<p>Miss Rose held the glass to
her lips now and then, but she
did not drink.</p>
<p>When Miss Rose wiped her
face with a cold, wet cloth, she
smiled a faint little smile, as if
she liked it. Then the look of
pain would come again, as she
turned restlessly.</p>
<p>The clock outside struck one.
How slowly the minutes went.</p>
<p>At last it struck two, and a
breeze stirred the leaves outside.</p>
<p>They were the leaves of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
maple Clematis had broken in the
early Spring. Now they seemed
to whisper softly to each other.</p>
<p>All else was silent.</p>
<p>Miss Rose had watched a long
time. Many days she had been
by the bed. Her eyes began to
droop.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll rest my head just a
minute,&#8221; she thought, and leaned
back upon the chair.</p>
<p>Slowly the clock struck three.
As the last stroke came, Miss Rose
stirred, and opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Then she started up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must have been asleep,&#8221; she
said aloud. &#8220;Oh, shame on me
for sleeping, when I promised to
watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked down at the bed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>Clematis lay there, peaceful
and quiet. Her little hand was
white and still as marble. Her
face seemed very happy. All pain
was gone, and a smile lay upon
the pale lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, little Clematis. To think
I should have been asleep!&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rose took out her handkerchief,
and bent her head down
on the bed, weeping.</p>
<p>A slight sound seemed to come
from the pillow. Miss Rose looked
up.</p>
<p>The child&#8217;s eyes were open
wide. She was looking at her in
wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said I could go, didn&#8217;t
he?&#8221; said Clematis in a faint
voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>Miss Rose choked down her
sobs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, Clematis, he did, he
did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, what are you
crying about?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis closed her eyes again
and lay, still as before, with a
little smile on her lips.</p>
<p>Miss Rose was so astonished
that she sat staring at her for
some minutes, until she heard a
step in the hall.</p>
<p>It was Doctor Wyatt.</p>
<p>He came in softly and looked
at the little figure on the bed.</p>
<p>He felt her pulse, and listened
to her heart. Then he smiled,
and led Miss Rose from the
room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She is all right now,&#8221; he
whispered. &#8220;Let her sleep as long
as she can.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>GETTING WELL</h3>
</div>

<p>Clematis slept all night, and
all the next day. It was evening
when she woke.</p>
<p>Miss Rose was beside the bed,
and heard her as she moved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you feel better now, dear
little girl?&#8221; asked Miss Rose.</p>
<p>Clematis looked at her a
moment with eyes wide open.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said I could go, didn&#8217;t
he?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, surely he did, and you
can go; you shall go just as soon
as you are well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis smiled a happy smile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I want a drink of that orange
juice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rose brought a glass with
ice in it, and held it, while
Clematis sipped it slowly. Then
she washed her face and hands in
cold water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; the little girl whispered,
as she turned on the pillow,
and went off to sleep again.</p>
<p>There was great joy all through
the Home, for every one knew that
Clematis was getting well.</p>
<p>Doctor Wyatt came every day
to look at his little sick girl, and
laugh, and pat her cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;You just wait till you see the
apple pies my aunt can make,&#8221;
he would say.</p>
<p>Then Clematis would smile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me about the garden.
Are there any lilacs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No lilac blossoms now, little
sister, but asters, and hollyhocks,
and goldenrod. You just wait
till you see them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the doctor would go out,
with another laugh.</p>
<p>Soon Clematis got so well that
she could sit up in bed.</p>
<p>Miss Rose would sit by the
window, sewing, and sometimes
she would read a story.</p>
<p>One afternoon she saw that
Clematis was anxious about something.
She had a little wrinkle
in her forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it you are thinking
about? Is there something you
want?&#8221;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

In the country at last<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>Miss Rose went and stood by
the bed, smoothing her forehead
with her soft hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking,&#8221; said Clematis.
&#8220;I was thinking that&mdash;that
perhaps I could have Deborah
come to see me, just for a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you wait a minute, and
I&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rose went out, and Clematis
waited to hear her steps
again. She had not seen Deborah
for a long time.</p>
<p>Soon she heard Miss Rose coming
back. She shut her eyes till
the footsteps came up to the bed,
and before she opened them, there
was a little pounce beside her.</p>
<p>Her dear Deborah was rubbing
a cold nose against her cheek, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
purring how glad she was to see
her.</p>
<p>Clematis smoothed and patted
her a long time, as she lay purring
close by her side.</p>
<p>After that, Deborah came up
often, and lay there on the bed,
while Miss Rose sewed by the
window.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you sewing?&#8221; asked
Clematis one day, when she was
well enough to sit up.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like a dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what it is. It&#8217;s
a new dress for a little girl to
wear to the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, who is going to have
it? Let me see it. Please hold
it up.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>Miss Rose held the dress before
her. It was nearly done.</p>
<p>The skirt was of serge, navy
blue, with two pockets. With it
went a middy blouse, with white
lacings at the neck, and white stars
on the sleeves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please tell me. Who is
going to have it?&#8221; The child&#8217;s
eyes danced as she saw the pretty
dress.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you just one guess,&#8221;
said Miss Rose, smiling.</p>
<p>Clematis gasped. Could it be
for her? She had never dreamed
of owning a dress like that.</p>
<p>The little girl sat there a
moment, without speaking. Then
she pointed one finger at herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right, the very first time,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
said Miss Rose. &#8220;This blouse is
to travel in. There is another.&#8221;</p>
<p>She reached down and lifted
another blouse. This was white,
with blue collar and cuffs, and a
blue star on the sleeve.</p>
<p>All this was too much for
Clematis. The tears stood in
her eyes, and she breathed fast.
But she did not say very much to
speak her gratitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thanks,&#8221; was all she said.
Miss Rose saw in her face how
much it all meant to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am proud of this little patient,&#8221;
said Doctor Wyatt, the
next day. &#8220;If she keeps on at
this rate, we can send her up to
Tilton next week.&#8221;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i15.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 295px; height: 458px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 295px;'>
&#8220;What are you sewing?&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></div>
<p>How her eyes shone! How her
heart jumped! The very next
week she would be starting for
the land of her dreams.</p>
<p>She could see great fields of
grass, with daisies and clover.
Already she could see them
stretching out before her.</p>
<p>How she got through the days
before she was to start, she never
knew. She was well enough now
to sleep in the dormitory once
more; to eat with the other children,
and do some of the work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now dear,&#8221; said Miss Rose,
the day before she was to start,
&#8220;I must leave you. I am going
away, too, for a vacation, so I
must say goodby today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis looked up in surprise.
She never thought that grown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
people wanted to go away. She
did not notice how pale and tired
Miss Rose was. It had been hard
work for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will try to help all you
can, won&#8217;t you, dear? Think
every minute of what you can do
to help. Then people will love
you, even if you make mistakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m, I will promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can wear the blue blouse,
and you can put the white one in
the box I gave you, if you are
afraid of crushing it in the little
bag.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&#8217;m, I don&#8217;t want to
put it in the bag.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, goodby, and have
a good time. Jerry will see that
you get on the right train.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>Jerry was the old cab man, who
had a stand near the school, and
carried people to the station.</p>
<p>This was a new delight for
Clematis. What fun to ride to
the station with Jerry, in a cab!</p>
<p>All day the joyful thoughts of
her trip filled her mind. She
could think of nothing else. The
other children laughed at her, but
she never minded them at all.</p>
<p>She was going to the country,
to the birds, and flowers, and
fields, and that was all she
cared.</p>
<p>But as she was going to bed,
one thought seemed to disturb her.
She lay there thinking, with the
little anxious line across her forehead.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>A long time she thought. Then
she spoke half aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I&#8217;ll do,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to, anyway.
I don&#8217;t care if the blouse is crushed
a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she went to sleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>OFF FOR TILTON</h3>
</div>

<p>The day that she had longed
for came at last. The sun was
bright, the breeze was cool, and
Clematis was as happy as the
sparrows that hopped about in
the maple tree.</p>
<p>All the morning she ran here and
there, getting her things ready.</p>
<p>She had a small, black bag,
and the box Miss Rose left for
her extra blouse. Her things were
put into these.</p>
<p>Mrs. Snow had an early lunch
for Clematis, because she was
going on the one o&#8217;clock train.

<p>&#8220;I would rather eat it down in
the kitchen with Katie,&#8221; she said,
when they started to put a bowl
on the big table.</p>
<p>Katie was willing, so Clematis
had some bread and soup on the
corner of the kitchen table.</p>

With Katie in the kitchen<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;It will be nearer the street,
so I will bring my things down
here,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She seemed very nervous, but
Katie thought it was because of
her trip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Miss Clematis,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Jerry will soon be
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it.&#8221; Clematis looked
around. Then she slipped out
of her chair and went up to
Katie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>She whispered a minute in her
friendly ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, now dearie, I wouldn&#8217;t
be doing that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Katie put her hand on the
little girl&#8217;s cheek, and shook her
head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think they would
like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Clematis was very serious.
The tears came into her eyes as
she whispered again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please, please! I don&#8217;t
know what might happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; answered Katie,
&#8220;what I don&#8217;t see, I don&#8217;t know
about. I&#8217;m going upstairs a
minute. Be quick now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went upstairs, and Clematis
hurried into the small room
near the kitchen, with her box.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>In a minute she came out again,
looking all about.</p>
<p>When Katie came down, she
was drinking her soup. She could
not swallow the bread.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear child,&#8221; said Katie, as
the bell rang. &#8220;I hope the worry
doesn&#8217;t make her sick again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jerry was ready with the cab.</p>
<p>&#8220;All aboard, mum, I&#8217;ll take
your things.&#8221;</p>
<p>He started to take the box,
which she hugged up under one
arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no thank you,&#8221; she cried,
and held on to it tighter than
ever.</p>
<p>Katie gave him the black bag
she had in her hand, and the next
minute Clematis was safe inside,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
and throwing a kiss to the friendly
cook.</p>
<p>Before he got to the station,
old Jerry stopped, and went into
a store. He came out with a big
paper bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;Katie told me to get this for
you, miss,&#8221; he said, as he passed
the bag to her through the open
window.</p>
<p>She peeped inside. There was
a smaller bag, and several big
peaches.</p>
<p>In the smaller bag were sandwiches,
and cream cakes.</p>
<p>What a treat! Clematis often
longed for peaches, but had not
tasted them very often.</p>
<p>In the station Jerry got down,
and led her to the train.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here is a passenger for Tilton,
New Hampshire,&#8221; he said to
the conductor.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Jerry, I&#8217;ll look
after her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The big conductor smiled at
the little passenger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, sister,&#8221; he said, as
he stooped to take her box.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, thank you,&#8221; said
Clematis, hugging it closer than
ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;She must have her money in
that,&#8221; laughed Jerry.</p>
<p>So the conductor took the two
bags, while Clematis carried the
box. He found her a seat
where she could be right by the
window.</p>
<p>Soon the train started. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
went across bridges, and through
the yards, till at last they came
to the open country.</p>
<p>There Clematis could see the
fields, and the flowers, which
grew close by the tracks.</p>
<p>As the train flew on, they
came to quiet woods, with little
brooks, and cows resting comfortably
in the shade.</p>
<p>There was so much to see, that
Clematis could not take her face
from the window a minute.</p>
<p>Farmers were at work in the
fields of wheat, and corn, and
oats. They were mowing and
raking. Some were throwing hay
into the big carts.</p>
<p>At last they came to a big
river that ran along by the track.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
Clematis could see people fishing
along the banks, and rowing on
the smooth water.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope there is a river in
Tilton,&#8221; she thought.</p>
<p>It was a long time before she
thought of the peaches, and sandwiches.
When she did, she knew
she was very hungry, so she
opened the bag, and ate, while
she watched the river, and fields,
and forests.</p>
<p>One sandwich she broke in
halves. She raised the cover of
the box a little, and put one half
inside. Then she shut the cover
and tied the string.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tilton is the next station,&#8221;
said the conductor, at last.</p>
<p>They went along beside a small
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
river, across a bridge, and the
train stopped at Tilton.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that little girl is for
me,&#8221; said a tall man with a
pleasant face, as Clematis came
down the steps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her tag says Mrs. Alder on
it, is that the one?&#8221; asked the
conductor.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. I told Mrs.
Alder I would bring her along
when I came from the train.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, here&#8217;s her bag. She
won&#8217;t let any one touch her box.
She keeps her money in it. Goodby,
little girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too&mdash;too&mdash;too-too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The whistle blew, the wheels
began to turn, and the long train
drew slowly away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Right over here, little girl.
Climb right up on the seat. I&#8217;ll
hold your box.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no thank you,&#8221; said
Clematis. &#8220;I&#8217;ll keep it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she looked up at the
seat. How was she to climb up
there and hold her box?</p>
<p>Suddenly she was lifted off the
ground, and found herself safe on
the high seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way we&#8217;ll fix it,&#8221;
said the man, with a smile. &#8220;Up
you go, money, box, and all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I want to go up the
street about a mile or so, before
I take you to Mrs. Alder. I
don&#8217;t suppose you mind, do
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis shook her head. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
was happy at the thought of
another ride.</p>
<p>So they drove up a long hill.
As they reached the top, the man
stopped his horse, and looked
about.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Clematis nodded, and looked all
about her.</p>
<p>The hill sloped down again into
a little valley, where the brook
ran between green meadows.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the pastures ran
up to meet the forest on another
hill.</p>
<p>Looking past this hill, she
could see the blue waters of a lake,
sparkling in the evening sun.</p>
<p>From the lake the ground rose
once more. Up and up it went,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
with pastures and forests, until it
came to the rocky crowns of three
mountains.</p>
<p>The mountains were a deep,
misty blue. Above them rose the
white August clouds, rolling on
and on, into the highest heaven.</p>
<p>Clematis drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is lovely,&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>Not far from where they
stopped was a white house, with
the blinds closed. Vines ran
about the front, and all seemed
lonely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who lives there?&#8221; she asked,
finding her tongue at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one lives there now. A
nice old man used to live there,
but he had a good deal of sadness.
He shut up the house, and went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
to live in a little place over near
Bean Hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed over to another hill
which rose in the east.</p>
<p>Clematis would have liked
to know more about the man
who could leave such a lovely
place, but the horse started on
again.</p>
<p>Soon they turned into another
road, and before long were turning
back toward the village.</p>
<p>All the way along, Clematis
could see the blue mountains in
the distance. She could not take
her eyes from them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there is your house,&#8221;
said the man, at last, pointing to
a neat, white house.</p>
<p>Clematis looked all about. Yes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
there were gardens, and flowers,
and fields, and trees.</p>
<p>There was a cow down by a
little brook.</p>
<p>Everything she had hoped to
find was there. There was a tall
maple beside the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is Clematis, I
guess,&#8221; said a lady, coming down
the path.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much, Mr.
Ladd. I see she came right side
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took the bag Mr. Ladd
handed down, and reached for the
box that Clematis still hugged in
her lap.</p>
<p>Clematis started to explain, but
Mrs. Alder did not wait. She
was nervous and quick.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>She pulled the box out of her
hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why Clematis, what is in
this box?&#8221; Mrs. Alder looked at
it in surprise.</p>
<p>Clematis did not answer. She
gasped, and turned red as a
rooster&#8217;s comb.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s her money, Mrs. Alder,&#8221;
said Mr. Ladd, laughing. &#8220;She
has it tied up for safe keeping.
The conductor told me so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Alder lifted one corner of
the box to peep in.</p>
<p>There was a scratching sound,
and then out popped a little white,
furry head, with sharp ears, and
one black eye.</p>
<p>It was Deborah.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE COUNTRY</h3>
</div>

<p>When Mr. Ladd saw the little
white head peep out, he put his
head back and laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I pity the rats in your barn
now, Mrs. Alder,&#8221; he shouted.</p>
<p>Mrs. Alder frowned at first, but
when she looked at Clematis, and
saw her anxious face, she smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth made you
bring that cat way up here?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s my own cat. I was
afraid to leave her at the Home
all alone. Would you like to
leave your cat alone, where people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
might throw it away while you
were gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then a tall man with a
gray beard walked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Mary,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We have plenty of milk in the
dairy, and plenty of rats in the
barn.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time Clematis had
Deborah safe in her arms, and
Mr. Alder led the way to the
house, while Mr. Ladd drove off,
laughing as he went.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you can take the cat
down to the barn. I won&#8217;t have
it in the house,&#8221; said Mrs. Alder.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, we&#8217;ll find a place
for her,&#8221; said Mr. Alder. He
took Clematis by the hand, and
they went down to the barn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>A gray horse poked his head
from a box stall to look at the
little visitor, and a little red hen
called her chickens, and hastened
away, clucking, as if she were
very angry.</p>
<p>Clematis turned to look at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever have any chickens?&#8221;
asked Mr. Alder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I never saw any.&#8221;
Clematis could not take her eyes
from the little chicks, as they ran
after their anxious mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have lots of things to
show you here. Let&#8217;s put your
cat up in the loft now.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went up a set of stairs,
and there was a loft, full of sweet
hay.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i16.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 302px; height: 468px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 302px;'>
Clematis stuck one hand out<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There now, Mrs. Tabby, you
will find a good bed, and good
hunting here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her name isn&#8217;t Tabby, it&#8217;s
Deborah,&#8221; said Clematis, as she
put her down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s quite a name. It
suits her very well.&#8221; Mr. Alder
led the way down again.</p>
<p>At the other end of the barn,
a red and white calf came up to
meet them.</p>
<p>It put out its wet nose to smell
the little visitor, and made her
start back.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wants to say &#8216;how do&#8217;. He
loves little girls,&#8221; said Mr. Alder.</p>
<p>Clematis stuck one hand out
timidly, and pulled it back again,
when the calf tried to lick it with
his rough tongue.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He wants just a little taste,&#8221;
laughed Mr. Alder. &#8220;Come on
now. Here is something else.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the end of the barn, Clematis
could hear strange noises.
There, in the yard, were some
smooth, white animals running
about.</p>
<p>When Clematis came near the
fence, they ran and put their fore
feet up, and stuck their noses out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uff, uff,&#8221; they said. Then
they squealed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know! Those are pigs!&#8221;
cried Clematis, clapping her
hands.</p>
<p>Eight clean, white pigs were
grunting and squealing for their
supper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Squeal away, piggies,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
Mr. Alder. &#8220;Supper will be along
soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a moment, he brought from
the dairy a bright milk pail.
Then they went down to the gate,
and he called:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come boss, come boss. Come
Betty.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sleek, plump cow came over
the hill, and hurried down to the
gate. It was just the color of a
mouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear old Betty. Steady now.&#8221;
Betty pushed through, and walked
fast to the barn, where she began
to whisper to her calf, and lap it
with her great rough tongue.</p>
<p>As Clematis came up, Betty
put her head down, and shook
her horns.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Behave, Betty. You ought
to be ashamed,&#8221; said Mr. Alder.
&#8220;You see, she won&#8217;t let any
strangers near her calf.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he took some grain and
put it in Betty&#8217;s box, while he tied
her head, and sat down on the
stool beside her.</p>
<p>Clematis had never seen a cow
milked before, and stood watching
the white streams which filled
the foaming pail, as if Mr. Alder
were a fairy. It seemed like
magic.</p>
<p>When the pail was full, Mr.
Alder poured some into a shiny
can, and took the rest to the
dairy.</p>
<p>There he poured it into a red
machine, with a big bowl. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
turned the handle, and soon two
streams came out.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that for?&#8221; Clematis
thought this might be some new
magic. Indeed it was magic,
almost.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the separator,&#8221; answered
Mr. Alder. &#8220;I pour the
milk in at the top, and turn the
handle. Then the cream comes
out of one spout, and the skimmed
milk from the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; said Clematis,
though it really was all like magic
to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I guess we are through.
Let&#8217;s go up and see what they
have for supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Alder took the empty pail,
and led her back to the house,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
where supper was ready and
waiting.</p>
<p>The smell of hot biscuit made
Clematis feel very hungry, and she
was glad that supper was all ready.</p>
<p>With the biscuit, was golden
butter, and apple sauce.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like warm milk right
from the cow?&#8221; asked Mrs. Alder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; replied Clematis,
with a nod.</p>
<p>So Mrs. Alder put a little
pitcher, with a glass, not much
bigger than a thimble, beside her
plate.</p>
<p>She could pour it out herself,
as often as she emptied her glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better leave room for some
fresh blueberry pie, and a piece of
cheese,&#8221; said Mr. Alder.</p>

</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>Blueberry pie and cheese, hot
biscuit and fresh milk, and golden
butter, all she wanted; surely,
Sally never had any supper better
than this.</p>
<p>The shadows were falling, and
the August crickets were beginning
their evening concert, when
Clematis had eaten the last bit of
pie on her plate.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Sand Man is coming, I
do believe,&#8221; said Mr. Alder, as he
reached over to pinch her cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t wonder, the
trip was a long one for a little
girl. You shall go right to bed,
Clematis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Alder took a lamp as she
spoke, and led the little visitor to
the stairs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good night, sleep tight, don&#8217;t
let the skeeters bite.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Alder called after her as
she went up.</p>
<p>Clematis laughed. Her eyes
were drooping, and her feet were
heavy, as she climbed the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;There now, we&#8217;ll have you
tucked in before a cat can say
Jack Sprat,&#8221; said Mrs. Alder, as
she unbuttoned her boots.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t I got to fold my
clothes?&#8221; asked Clematis, as Mrs.
Alder began picking them up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind about them tonight.
Here&#8217;s a wet cloth. We&#8217;ll
just have a quick wash, and into
bed you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bed was soft; the pillows
were softer; and the song of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
evening breeze in the maple, without
her open window, was softer
still.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am in the country,&#8221; sighed
Clematis. &#8220;I can hear the trees,
and I can smell the flowers now.
Tomorrow I will&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>I wish I could tell you what
she was going to do. I can&#8217;t,
for just then, she fell fast asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>CLEMATIS TRIES TO HELP</h3>
</div>

<p>The birds in the maple tree
woke Clematis early the next
morning.</p>
<p>For a minute she did not
know where she was. Then she
hopped out of bed and ran to the
window.</p>
<p>The sun was up. The birds
were singing all about. The smell
of clover and sweet grass came to
her open window.</p>
<p>There, across the valley, lay
the mountains she saw in the
evening.</p>
<p>Now they were not blue. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
could see the rocks and the bushes,
in the morning light. But they
were just as lovely as before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;some day
I&#8217;ll go and climb up those mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she washed carefully at
the stand by the window, for she
remembered what Miss Rose had
said.</p>
<p>When she was dressed, she
started down stairs. Then she
thought again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must help all I can. I guess
I&#8217;ll make the bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she drew the clothes neatly
over the bed, and smoothed the
pillow. Then she went down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Clematis,&#8221;
said Mrs. Alder. &#8220;I see you get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
up before breakfast. Did you
have a good sleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; replied Clematis.
&#8220;Would you like me to help
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you had better run out
and see what Mr. Alder is doing.
You can help me after breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Clematis ran out.</p>
<p>How loud the birds sounded in
the clear air. How they chirped
and twittered. How sweet the
smell of the flowers, and how
bright the sun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s the little red
hen!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;But she has
lost her chickens. Every one is
gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was the little hen, sitting
on the ground, near the barn door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>Just then Mr. Alder came out
with a pail of milk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Alder, where have
all the chickens gone?&#8221; cried
Clematis.</p>
<p>He laughed. &#8220;Dear me,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see them anywhere,
do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but they were all here
last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if the rats caught
them.&#8221; Mr. Alder looked very
sad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, if they did, I&#8217;ll tell
Deborah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis looked as if she were
ready to cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry. I&#8217;ll get a fairy
to bring them back. You turn
around and shut your eyes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>He turned her around. &#8220;Now,
are your eyes shut?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you must say, &#8216;Fairy,
Fairy, bring back my chicks.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairy, Fairy, bring back my
chicks,&#8221; said Clematis, laughing.</p>
<p>She heard the little red hen
clucking behind her. Then she
heard the chickens peeping.</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn round,&#8221; said Mr. Alder.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes; she turned
around; and there were the chicks,
running about their mother.</p>
<p>She was just going to cry out
in surprise, when the hen lifted
her wings, and two more ran out
from beneath them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know. She had them
under her feathers all the time.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>Clematis laughed and danced
about, while the red hen clucked
to her chicks and walked off very
angry indeed.</p>
<p>Mr. Alder laughed also, and
picked up the pail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see that patch of
raspberries down there, just beyond
the hen house?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Clematis nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there are some big,
late raspberries down there.
Would you like to pick a few?
You&#8217;ll find them good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For me to eat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, eat all you can find.
They are good for little city girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you.&#8221; Clematis
started toward the patch of raspberries.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>Then she stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must see Deborah first,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I wonder if she caught
any rats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure, I forgot Deborah.
Give her my love.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Alder went to separate
his milk, while Clematis found
Deborah sound asleep on the hay,
and ready to visit the raspberry
patch.</p>
<p>Soon the bell for breakfast
rang, and Clematis ran to the
house. Her lips and fingers were
red with raspberries, for she had
found big ones.</p>
<p>By her plate was her tiny glass,
and a pitcher of rich milk. There
were corn flakes, and shredded
wheat first, and then toast, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
bacon, and big baked apples with
cream.</p>
<p>Clematis had never really expected
to have such things to eat.
The stories other little girls had
told her, all had seemed like fairy
tales.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you can help me a while,
if you wish,&#8221; said Mrs. Alder,
after breakfast. &#8220;Can you wash
dishes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&#8217;m, I can do that all
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis looked after Mr.
Alder with longing eyes. He
was going to feed the pigs. She
longed to go too, but she knew
she must help all she could.</p>
<p>So she started in on the plates
and cups.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>The water was hot, and she
found it hard work to hold the
china. Just as she was lifting
a cup, it slipped from her
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gracious, what was that?&#8221;
asked Mrs. Alder. She thought
a good deal of her china.</p>
<p>The cup was taken out. A
piece was broken from the edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear me. I have had
those cups for twenty years. I
guess I&#8217;ll finish the dishes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis said nothing, but
turned very red. She almost
cried, she was so ashamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t worry too much
about it,&#8221; said Mrs. Alder. &#8220;You
can help me with the beds. I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
sure you can make your bed without
doing any harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&#8217;m, I&#8217;ve made it
already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Made it already? When?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, when I got up, before
breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy! Go right up and pull
the clothes back. It must always
air for an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor Clematis went up and
pulled the clothes back to air.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I help, if every
single thing I do is wrong?&#8221;
Clematis spoke crossly out the
window at the robin on the edge
of the roof.</p>
<p>Then she felt a crumb in her
pocket, and pushed up the screen
to throw it out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>Mr. Robin flew away, and Mrs.
Alder came in at that moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear child, what on earth
have you put up that screen for?
Do you want to fill the house
with flies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m, I didn&#8217;t know&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, never mind. You
don&#8217;t know much, I guess. I
promised to take you, and I&#8217;ll
keep my word, but it&#8217;s no use
trying to fit city children into
real homes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Alder shut the screen with
a bang.</p>
<p>&#8220;There now, you run along
out doors. I guess you and Mr.
Alder will get along all right, but
don&#8217;t touch anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, it looks like rain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
What&#8217;s the trouble, sister?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Alder smiled and pinched
her cheek, as he met Clematis at
the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to help,&#8221; said Clematis,
drying her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see. You didn&#8217;t do
things quite right, did you? Well,
I wouldn&#8217;t fret about that. I
don&#8217;t do things quite right, myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis smiled through her
tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on now, and help me
pick some late peas for dinner.
You will like that, I am sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took her hand, and soon
she was happy again.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, you picked two quarts,
and did it well, too. Now take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
these up to Mrs. Alder, and
tell her you can shell them out,
every one, without hurting a
thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Mrs. Alder, in the
kitchen. &#8220;You think you can
shell peas, do you? Well, take
them out under the maple tree.
Then I won&#8217;t have the pods all
around the kitchen.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Clematis proved that she
could shell peas, after all.</p>
<p>Mrs. Alder gave her a cookie
for her pay, and said she had
done very well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;ll get along all
right, if you stay out doors,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Clematis, eating
the cookie as she went out.
She was glad enough to stay out
doors.</p>

I guess he&#8217;ll be glad I&#8217;m here.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>ONLY A FEW DAYS MORE</h3>
</div>

<p>Clematis did help Mr. Alder,
and tried hard, in her way, to
make herself useful.</p>
<p>She helped Mrs. Alder too, for
she went on errands to the village
every time she was asked.</p>
<p>Every day she went to the
Post Office. She took home the
letters and carried home bundles
from the stores.</p>
<p>Clematis loved this walk, because
the road ran down by
Knapp&#8217;s saw mill, and by the
river.</p>
<p>Near the stocking mill, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
river came right up to the road,
and she could even see the little
fish, in the clear water.</p>
<p>Sometimes she stopped longer
than she thought, and was late
getting back, but Mrs. Alder did
not scold her.</p>
<p>&#8220;The less we expect of her,
the less we shall be disappointed,&#8221;
she would say.</p>
<p>On Sunday, they all went
down to church to hear Mr. Sampson
preach.</p>
<p>He smiled at her in his kindly
way, when she went out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see, I don&#8217;t know
your name, do I?&#8221; he asked,
taking her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Clematis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Clematis, I&#8217;m glad to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
see you. I hope you will come
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That little girl looks just like
another little girl I used to know,&#8221;
he said to Mr. Alder.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is here for a week or two.
Doctor Wyatt sent her up.&#8221; Mr.
Alder whispered to him a minute,
before they went away.</p>
<p>&#8220;How would you like to
take a long walk this afternoon,
Clematis?&#8221; said Mr. Alder, while
she was eating her ice cream and
cake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, let&#8217;s.&#8221; Clematis
was glad enough. She never
liked Sundays very well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good, we can walk up Bean
Hill, if you think you can go that
far.&#8221;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i17.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 298px; height: 464px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 298px;'>
She could see the little fish<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can walk farther than
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they started out, while Mrs.
Alder lay down for a nap.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t go by the road, but
crossed the river in a boat that
Mr. Alder kept tied to the bank.</p>
<p>Then they walked through the
trees and meadows by the path.</p>
<p>Clematis was full of joy. New
birds sang here. New trees, and
new flowers met her at each turn.</p>
<p>After they had walked about a
mile, they came to a little cabin,
set among maple trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who lives here?&#8221; asked Clematis.
It looked like the cabins
she had seen in her picture books.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one lives here now. This
is where they boil down their sap
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
in the spring. They make maple
syrup, and maple sugar.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were the big pans, turned
upside down, and the pails that
caught the sap.</p>
<p>Her mouth watered as she
thought of all the maple sugar
they had made in that little cabin.
She wanted to stay longer, but
Mr. Alder started on.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must get along, I want
to see Mr. Brooks before we go
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Mr. Brooks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Brooks is a good man
who lives over here on the side of
Bean Hill. He lives all alone by
himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; replied Clematis, &#8220;is he
the man who owns the white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
house with the vines, and has had
so much sadness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. How did you know
about him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Ladd stopped near his
house. He told me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The walk was a long one, and
Clematis was glad when she saw
the little cottage on the hillside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are. There is Mr.
Brooks now, working over his
flowers.&#8221; Mr. Alder went over to
the little garden, where a man with
white hair was pulling out weeds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good day, Mr. Alder. Glad
enough to see you. Come up
and sit on the piazza.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Brooks smiled, as he wiped
his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;And here is a lady, too,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
added. &#8220;I believe I have never
met her.&#8221;</p>
<p>He held out his hand to
Clematis with a kindly smile, and
led them to the piazza.</p>
<p>Mr. Alder told him who she
was, while Clematis was looking
at the neat little cottage.</p>
<p>A vine was growing about the
door, with little white flowers,
peeping out from its green leaves.</p>
<p>Mr. Brooks saw her looking at it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like the flowers?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&mdash;it is just the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean? What
is just the same?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, just the same vine as
the one on the white house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She saw the old home place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
when she drove over with Mr.
Ladd,&#8221; said Mr. Alder. &#8220;She
remembered the vine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you like it. You
ought to like it, Clematis, because
it has your own name,&#8221; added
Mr. Alder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, is her name Clematis?&#8221;
Mr. Brooks took her on
his knee and looked into her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had a little girl like
you,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>She sat there on his knee, while
he talked with Mr. Alder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will come again,
Clematis. You will, if you get a
chance, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; Mr. Brooks
said, as they started to go.</p>
<p>He brought out a big, sweet
pear, and put it into her hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You can eat that on the way
home,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>All the way home Clematis
kept thinking of Mr. Brooks, and
the vine, and how he had looked
into her face while she sat on his
knee.</p>
<p>She had never known any
father or mother, and people
didn&#8217;t have time to hold her that
way at the Home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could we go again?&#8221; she
asked, as they crossed the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps. We&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they got home, Mrs.
Alder was sitting on the back
steps.</p>
<p>Beside her, in the grass, lay
three dead chickens.</p>
<p>&#8220;How on earth did those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
chickens get killed?&#8221; asked Mr.
Alder, as he took one in his
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why on earth did that child
ever bring her old cat up here?
That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to know.&#8221;
Mrs. Alder was cross.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Deborah do that? Dear
me! We&#8217;ll have to shut her up
in the loft.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where she is, and
that&#8217;s where she&#8217;ll stay,&#8221; said
Mrs. Alder. &#8220;Remember now,
Clematis. Don&#8217;t you let her
get out again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; said Clematis.</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t know what else to
say, so she went sadly to the loft.
There she found Deborah, sleeping
sweetly, as if she had never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
done a thing wrong in the
world.</p>
<p>She sat down by the open window,
and looked across the river
valley, and across the lake, to the
mountains.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh dear!&#8221; she sighed.</p>
<p>She heard Mrs. Alder speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care, I think the Doctor
was asking a good deal of us,
to keep a strange child like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mary, never mind. It
is only for a few days longer. I
guess we can stand it. Think of
the pleasure it gives Clematis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Alder spoke kindly, but as
Clematis heard the words, she
turned pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a few days more. Only
a few days more.&#8221; The words
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
went through her mind again and
again.</p>
<p>She had never thought about
going back. Two weeks seems a
long, long time to little girls.
Only a few days more before she
must leave Tilton.</p>
<p>Clematis put her elbows on the
window sill, and rested her chin
in her hands.</p>
<p>The sun was setting behind
the maple tree. The golden rays
gleamed in the white mist that
had risen from the river, for it
was a cold evening.</p>
<p>In the distance the Belmont
mountains were a deep, misty
blue, and the clouds above them
all white and gold.</p>
<p>Now all the valley was filling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
with a golden mist. The birds
were singing in the trees along
the banks of the river. They
filled the evening air with joyous
songs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a few days more. Only
a few days more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon she must go back to the
brick walls, and the yard with the
high fence around it.</p>
<p>When Mr. Alder came to call
Clematis for supper, her eyes were
red, and her cheeks pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, dear little girl,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll keep Deborah
shut up. I guess we can spare
the chickens. We have plenty
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said nothing, but went
silently in for the evening meal.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
She had forgotten all about the
chickens. All through supper
the words ran in her head, and
the last thing in her mind as she
fell asleep was this thought:</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a few days more.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>WHERE IS CLEMATIS?</h3>
</div>

<p>On Monday Clematis found a
big, blue envelope, with the other
mail.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you have a letter for
your own self this time,&#8221; said
Mr. Morse, as he handed her the
mail.</p>
<p>Clematis did not stop to look
at the little fishes by the shore.
She hurried straight home.</p>
<p>It was a letter for her own self.
Miss Rose sent it to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I wish I had learned to
read. Please read mine first, Mrs.
Alder?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think that is polite?&#8221;
asked Mrs. Alder.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m, but you get lots of
letters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true. Well, let us
see.&#8221;</p>
<p>She opened the envelope, while
Clematis got close to her side.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Dear little Clematis:</p>
<p>I hope you are well, and having
a good time. I am sure you must
be having a splendid time, for
Tilton is a lovely place. I wish
I were with you.</p>
<p>What a naughty girl you were
to take Deborah, when she was
not invited. I hope Mrs. Alder
has forgiven you.</p>
<p>I am going to ask Mrs. Alder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
to send you home on the afternoon
train Saturday, so you
will be all ready when school
begins.</p>
<p>I shall be at the train to meet
you. Don&#8217;t forget Deborah.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:3em;'>Your true friend,</p>
<p>Rose Thornton.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>&#8220;That is a good letter for a
little girl to get, I am sure. Now
run out and play, while I read
my letters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis went out, rather slowly.
The letter made her think
again of the end of her stay, and
she was sad.</p>
<p>But the sun was bright, the
breeze was cool, and the birds sang
merrily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>She saw Mr. Alder down in the
garden, and ran to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I help you, Mr. Alder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not. I am weeding
late carrots, and I think you would
not know them from weeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should know them, honestly.
Just let me try a little bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, take this little
trowel. Make the earth loose
around them, and then pull the
weeds out with your fingers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis kneeled in the soft
earth, and began to work with the
trowel.</p>
<p>She weeded the row across from
Mr. Alder, where he could see
what she was doing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I declare! You are a
real gardener.&#8221; Mr. Alder patted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
her shoulder, and praised her well
when she had done several feet of
her row.</p>
<p>The little green tops of the
carrots all stood straight and clean.
Every weed was gone, but no carrots
were hurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you I could do it.
You did not believe me, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis smiled happily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I do now. I never
saw any one do better.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the man and the little girl
worked side by side beneath the
August sun.</p>
<p>The smell of the warm earth,
and the fresh growing things all
around her, made Clematis breathe
deeply.</p>
<p>She could hear the birds singing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
and see the mountains, across
the lakes.</p>
<p>While she was hard at work,
she almost forgot to be sad because
she was going back on the
Saturday train.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just look at that child,&#8221; said
Mrs. Alder, when they went in to
wash for dinner. &#8220;Has she been
weeding in her good clothes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has weeded two whole
rows of carrots, I know that much.
I&#8217;ll get her some new clothes when
those wear out. She is as much
help at weeding as a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis was as proud of that,
as Deborah was with her first rat.
In the afternoon Mrs. Alder found
her a pair of small overalls. These
covered her dress and kept her clean.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>It was a happy child that came
in at evening. She had worked
steadily, in the hot sun and the
breeze, and had finished all the
carrots.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know how much
help that has been, Clematis,&#8221;
said Mr. Alder. &#8220;It tires my
back to weed carrots, and now
they are all done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will weed tomorrow, too,&#8221;
she said, happy with her praise.</p>
<p>There was plenty to do, as
there always is on a farm, and
Clematis was busy all day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how she learns so
quickly,&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Alder,
when he was telling Mr. Ladd
about her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it is because she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
naturally loves it,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;It seems too bad that she couldn&#8217;t
live here in the country, she seems
to love it so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I wish Mrs. Alder was
better, and took to children more.
Clematis is clumsy in the house,
but out in the garden she is right
at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the days went on, with sunshine
and clouds, and Saturday
came nearer and nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clematis, what have you been
doing to the calendar in your
room?&#8221; asked Mrs. Alder, at dinner
on Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just looking to see how
many days till Saturday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you needn&#8217;t muss it up
that way.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>Every morning Clematis had
taken it down and counted the
days with her fingers.</p>
<p>Friday evening she did not eat
much supper, and was very silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Longing to get back home, I
guess,&#8221; said Mrs. Alder. &#8220;Well,
dear, you will be back with the
other children tomorrow. I
know what it is. I was homesick
myself when I was a child.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis did not answer. She
didn&#8217;t know how to tell what it
was that troubled her, so she
said nothing.</p>
<p>The stars were bright, and the
tiny moon was low in the sky,
before the weary eyes closed in
sleep.</p>
<p>Clematis had been thinking,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
and thinking. Tomorrow was
Saturday.</p>
<p>Early in the morning she was
awake again, by the window.</p>
<p>She leaned her head on her
hands, and began to think again.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what he said,&#8221; she
repeated, half aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is just what he said.
If he didn&#8217;t mean it, why did he
say it?&#8221;</p>
<p>At the breakfast table, Mrs.
Alder noticed how pale her cheeks
were.</p>
<p>&#8220;Try to eat some toast, dear,&#8221;
said Mrs. Alder. &#8220;You will soon
be home again. Only a few
hours more now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis raised her eyes, and
gave Mrs. Alder a strange look.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That child does beat all,&#8221;
said Mrs. Alder, after breakfast.
&#8220;She seems to be thinking a lot, but
she keeps as quiet as a stone jug.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is thinking; you may be
sure of that,&#8221; Mr. Alder replied.</p>
<p>All the morning Clematis went
about silently, except when she
was in the loft with Deborah.
Then she talked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t be afraid. I am a
big girl, Debby, and I shan&#8217;t be
a mite afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deborah could not speak, but
she snuggled up close, and purred,
so Clematis knew just what she
meant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be sure to have all your
things ready, Clematis,&#8221; called
Mrs. Alder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We shall have an early dinner,
for Mr. Ladd will be here
about one o&#8217;clock to take you to
the station.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; said Clematis, and
she went slowly to her room.</p>
<p>Before long, all was ready, and
dinner was on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, let&#8217;s eat a big dinner.
I roasted a chicken especially for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>How good the roast chicken
smelled! There were baked potatoes,
and peas, and beans, too.</p>
<p>Clematis was hungry now.
She ate, and ate, and ate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good girl.&#8221; Mr. Alder patted
her on the head. &#8220;Travelers must
be well fed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be sure to wash all the blueberry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
off your mouth,&#8221; added
Mrs. Alder, as Clematis got down.</p>
<p>Clematis went to the sink and
washed her face and hands.
Then she went to the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget Deborah&#8217;s satin
dress, and velvet hat?&#8221; called Mr.
Alder.</p>
<p>She turned and smiled back at
him, as she went out.</p>
<p>Soon Mr. Ladd drove up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came a bit early,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got some milk for the
Seminary. Is Clematis ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, all ready, I guess. She
just went out to get her cat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Alder went to the back
door and called.</p>
<p>She waited a minute, but
Clematis did not come.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>She called again. No Clematis.
&#8220;Please go and get her,
Henry,&#8221; she said to Mr. Alder.
&#8220;Tell her to come right in.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a few minutes Mr.
Alder came back. He looked
puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, where is Clematis?&#8221;
asked Mrs. Alder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know? Isn&#8217;t she in
the loft?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps she went to
say goodby to the pigs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She must be around here
somewhere. She has no wings;
she can&#8217;t fly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure of that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
Mr. Alder smiled in a puzzled
way at Mr. Ladd.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just like you men.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Alder went to the door
and called as loudly as she could.
Then she went to the barn and
called again.</p>
<p>She looked all about. Mr.
Alder looked all about. Mr.
Ladd looked all about.</p>
<p>They all called once more.</p>
<p>It was of no use. Clematis
was gone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>HUNTING FOR CLEMATIS</h3>
</div>

<p>Mr. Alder looked at Mr. Ladd.
Mr. Ladd looked at Mrs. Alder.
They all looked at each other.</p>
<p>What should they do?</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mrs. Alder at
last, &#8220;you drive down street with
Mr. Ladd and find out if any one
has seen her. I will look all
about the farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men had not gone far down
the street when they met a boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, Ned! have you seen our
little girl?&#8221; called Mr. Alder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who, Clematis? Have you
lost her?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, she has lost herself. Have
you seen her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My gracious, no.&#8221; His blue
eyes opened almost as wide as
butter plates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, tell any one you see that
she&#8217;s lost; that&#8217;s a good boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My gracious, I guess I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Off ran little Ned Atkinson, as
fast as his legs would carry him.</p>
<p>He told every one he met, but
no one had seen Clematis.</p>
<p>Not far down the street Mr.
Knapp came rolling out of his yard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen that little girl
of ours, Mr. Knapp?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. I saw her. She&#8217;s
a likely gal. Quite spry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where was she?&#8221; Both men
spoke at once.</p>

</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, right along here, yesterday
morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean today. Have you
seen her today?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, I haven&#8217;t set eyes on
her today. What&#8217;s the matter?
Is she lost?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as if she were lost.
We can&#8217;t find her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she&#8217;ll be back.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8216;Let &#8217;em alone,</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>They heard his great voice echo
down the river, as they drove on.</p>
<p>Nobody had seen Clematis.
Nobody knew anything about her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Alder looked everywhere
at home.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>Her bag and box were neatly
packed and ready, but there was
no sign of the little girl who
owned them.</p>
<p>Many people were looking for
Clematis that afternoon.</p>
<p>Ned Atkinson ran everywhere,
telling people about the lost girl.</p>
<p>They looked in the woods and
in the fields. They looked all
along the river banks.</p>
<p>When night came, they were
still hunting, but had found no
trace of Clematis.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t sleep a wink tonight,&#8221;
said Mrs. Alder. &#8220;I think the
child must be crazy, to run off
like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel much like sleep
myself,&#8221; Mr. Alder replied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder where she can be
hiding.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning many people
came to ask if Clematis had been
found.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, no. There isn&#8217;t a
sign of her anywhere. I don&#8217;t
know what we shall do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Alder made the same
answer to every one.</p>
<p>During the day people still
looked about in new places.</p>
<p>Afternoon came again, but no
Clematis came with it.</p>
<p>Towards evening, Mr. Brooks
was sitting in his chair by his
little cottage, reading a book.</p>
<p>The sun was sinking behind
the mountains in the west.</p>
<p>The birds were singing their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
evening songs, in the trees by the
brook.</p>
<p>All was quiet and peaceful.</p>
<p>As he sat there, Mr. Brooks
heard steps on the path.</p>
<p>He looked down and saw a
little girl. In her arms was a cat,
with a black spot over one eye.</p>
<p>The child stumbled as she
walked. She seemed ready to
drop, she was so tired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, little girl, where did you
come from?&#8221; cried Mr. Brooks.</p>
<p>He got up and went down to
meet her.</p>
<p>Then she raised her pale face,
and he saw that it was Clematis.
Her face and hands were soiled;
her hair was tangled; her dress
was dusty and torn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, little maid,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Did you walk way over here to
see me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Clematis, faintly.
&#8220;I said I would, and I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear child, you are worn out.
Come in and rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took her into the little
house, and got a basin and
water.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, dear, wash your face
and hands. You will feel better.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now sit down, Clematis,&#8221;
said Mr. Brooks, when she had
finished washing her face and
hands, &#8220;and we will have a bite
to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>He cut a slice of bread. On
this he spread some butter, and
sprinkled a little sugar.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>Clematis watched him with
hungry eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear child, you must be
starved,&#8221; he said, as she took a
great bite.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you be hungry if
you hadn&#8217;t had any breakfast or
dinner?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis took another big bite.</p>
<p>&#8220;No breakfast? No dinner?
Where have you been all day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I stayed in the little house
where they boil the sap.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bread was nearly gone
now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you run away this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Brooks was cutting another
slice.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I stayed there last night.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You stayed there all last
night? Child! I should think
you would have frozen. There
was frost last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did freeze,&#8221; said Clematis,
beginning on the second slice.</p>
<p>Mr. Brooks looked at her a
moment in silence, while she ate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard anything to
beat that,&#8221; he said at last, as he
reached once more for the bread.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Alder will be very
anxious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No she won&#8217;t. She&#8217;ll be glad
I&#8217;m gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Brooks smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Alder will, anyway.
As soon as you have eaten a few
loaves of bread, I&#8217;ll get Mr. Giles&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
horse. They will be glad enough
to see you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis put down her bread.
Her lips quivered, and her eyes
filled with tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want me?&#8221; she
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear child, what do you
mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said you wished you had
a little girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I say that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you said you wished you
had a little girl, and you can have
me. Nobody wants me, except
you.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can make my bed, and wash

<p>Poor Clematis, she had never
said so much at one time in her
life.</p>
<p>Then she burst into tears. She
was tired, and worn, and faint.</p>
<p>Mr. Brooks took her into his
lap. He hardly knew what to
say to comfort her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you no father or
mother?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she sobbed, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t
anybody at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see I am all alone here.
I haven&#8217;t any good place to keep
a little girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care, I can sleep on
the floor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes were drooping, and
she was growing quiet. Her head
rested on his shoulder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>Mr. Brooks was thinking what
to say, when he looked down at
her face.</p>
<p>Her brown eyes were closed,
and she was fast asleep.</p>
<p>He held her there a while.
Then he took her into the next
room, and laid her on the bed.</p>
<p>Covered with a warm blanket,
she sighed softly, and sank into a
deep slumber.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t take her home tonight.
She ought to have a long, quiet
sleep,&#8221; said Mr. Brooks to himself.</p>
<p>He watched her a while. Then
he went out, up the mountain to
Mr. Giles&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>There he telephoned to Atkinson&#8217;s
store.</p>
<p>In another minute a little boy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
was racing up the street. He
called to every one on his way:</p>
<p>&#8220;Clematis is found! Clematis
is found! She&#8217;s up on Bean
Hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned shouted at the top of his
voice.</p>
<p>Clematis would have been surprised,
if she had seen how glad
Mrs. Alder was to know that she
was safe.</p>
<p>They sent a message to Miss
Rose, and told her that Clematis
was found.</p>
<p>Every one was glad. Every
one asked how she ever got way
up there on Bean Hill, but no
one knew.</p>
<p>All this time Clematis was
sleeping quietly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>When Mr. Brooks returned,
she had not stirred.</p>
<p>He stood and looked at her a
long, long time.</p>
<p>When he turned away there
were tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little elf,&#8221; he whispered.
&#8220;She thought I meant just what
I said.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spread some blankets on
the floor, and lay down, but he
did not go to sleep.</p>
<p>His thoughts went back to a
book he had been reading.</p>
<p>It was about Silas Marner, a
man who was sad and lonely.</p>
<p>Silas Marner took a little girl
into his tiny house to care for,
and she made his life happy
again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Silas Marner did not have so
large a home as this,&#8221; he thought.
&#8220;But he took good care of the
little girl. How happy they were
together.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little face, all wet with
tears, came before him again and
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might keep her for a little
while, at least,&#8221; he said to himself.
&#8220;I will see what Mr. Alder
thinks in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>NEW PLANS</h3>
</div>

<p>When Mr. Brooks woke in the
morning, Clematis was already
up. She had washed her face
and hands at the spring, near the
door, and was sitting on the step.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oho, so the little bird woke
first, did she?&#8221; said Mr. Brooks.</p>
<p>Clematis nodded, and looked
up shyly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking about you last
night before I went to sleep. Suppose
I should keep you with me
for a little while. Do you think
you would like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I would help like anything,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
she cried. &#8220;You just try
me, and see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I will talk to Mr.
Alder, and perhaps you can stay
for a while, at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Mr. Brooks talked with Mr.
Alder. Then he wrote to Mrs.
Snow.</p>
<p>Yes, Clematis might stay a
week.</p>
<p>How hard she tried!</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wash and wipe all the
dishes,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The very first day she broke a
cup. Then she cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me, don&#8217;t feel bad
about that. You are doing the
best you can, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Brooks laughed, and Clematis
smiled again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Men don&#8217;t care so much
about dishes,&#8221; she said to herself.</p>
<p>To be sure, Clematis had not
learned to do much, but she had
learned to do her best.</p>
<p>Mr. Brooks found that she
could help in many ways, and she
was so anxious to do her best,
that he gladly forgave her mistakes.</p>
<p>He made her a little bed in
the room upstairs.</p>
<p>At evening, she could hear the
wind whispering in the trees, and
the little brook that ran down
from the spring.</p>
<p>In the morning, she could see
the lakes and mountains across
the valley, as she sat by her open
window, while the birds hopped
about on the twigs, and sang
their sweetest songs.</p>

A little girl was coming up the path<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>Deborah slept each night in
a little box close by her bed,
and followed her about all day
long.</p>
<p>The week passed very quickly.
On Friday, Mr. Brooks saw that
she was silent and thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I can spare you
yet,&#8221; he said at breakfast. &#8220;I
must ask Mrs. Snow to let you
stay another week, at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clematis was never so happy.
She smiled and hummed a little
song all the morning. Now and
then she would stop to pat
Deborah, who slept by the stove.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is going to let me stay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
another week, Debby!&#8221; she would
whisper. &#8220;Another week, another
whole week.&#8221;</p>
<p>This week was passing also,
when Clematis had a great surprise.</p>
<p>It was a letter from Miss Rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, read it to me, read it to
me!&#8221; she exclaimed, as she climbed
up into Mr. Brooks&#8217;s lap.</p>
<p>So he opened the envelope and
read:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Dear Clematis:</p>
<p>Mr. Brooks has asked us if he
might keep you for a year. Do
you think you would like to
stay?</p>
<p>I shall go to see you in Tilton
next week, so you must be thinking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
it over, and decide if you
really want to stay?</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:3em;'>Your true friend,</p>
<p>Rose Thornton.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>After he had finished, Clematis
was silent for a moment. Then
she looked up at him with a happy
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please read it again,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>So he read it again, while she
sat still in his lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you would really
like to stay?&#8221; he asked, when he
had finished.</p>
<p>Clematis patted his hand, and
snuggled her face against his
shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can Debby stay, too?&#8221; she
asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course she can. We
couldn&#8217;t get along without
Debby.&#8221;</p>
<p>That night Clematis looked
out at the golden light, just fading
from the mountains.</p>
<p>A star was twinkling in the
sky. The brook was bubbling
down among the trees, and the
wind hummed a little tune in
their soft branches.</p>
<p>She was very happy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to be happy
always now,&#8221; she said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>THE TRUE FAIRY STORY</h3>
</div>

<p>The next week they got Mr.
Giles&#8217;s horse, and drove down to
meet Miss Rose at the station.</p>
<p>How glad Clematis was to see
her!</p>
<p>She sat in her lap all the way
back to Bean Hill, and told her
about the mountains, the lakes,
the trees, and the birds.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you think you would like
to stay a whole year, do you?&#8221;
asked Miss Rose.</p>
<p>Clematis smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deborah can stay too,&#8221; she
said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>When they got to the little
cottage, Miss Rose went in with
Mr. Brooks, and had a long
talk.</p>
<p>She told him all she knew about
Clematis.</p>
<p>He listened while she told him
how Clematis ran away, how the
policeman found her, and how she
came to the Home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any trace of her
father and mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they said the father&#8217;s
name was Jones, but I am not
sure that was her father&#8217;s true
name. Both her father and
mother died when she was a baby,
they say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Brooks looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the mother leave nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
when she died, that people might
know her by?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rose reached into her
little black bag and brought out
the picture. Mr. Brooks did not
take it at first.</p>
<p>&#8220;They said the father&#8217;s name
was Jones; did they tell you his
first name?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, just Jones. I could learn
no other name.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rose held out the picture,
and Mr. Brooks&#8217;s hand trembled
as he took it.</p>
<p>After one look, he carried it to
the window.</p>
<p>There he held it to the light,
and gazed at it a long time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see some one there
you know?&#8221; asked Miss Rose.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you know your
own daughter, if you saw her?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rose smiled. Then she
saw tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please forgive me for smiling,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;You reminded
me so much of Clematis. She
asks questions just like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, wouldn&#8217;t you expect her
to be like her own grandfather?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Mr. Brooks smiled too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she really your grandchild?&#8221;
exclaimed Miss Rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she is, she must be.
This is her mother here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed to one of the girls
in the picture.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was taken in front of
the Seminary, a year before she
ran away to be married.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it seems just like a fairy
story. I can hardly believe it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rose looked again at the
picture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is like a fairy story,&#8221;
Mr. Brooks replied. &#8220;Dear, wayward
girl. She needn&#8217;t have run
away. I would have gladly forgiven
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will take Clematis
to live with you, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes indeed. I have wondered
about that name, Clematis.
Her mother loved flowers. She
loved the clematis vine about the
door most of all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose she named Clematis
in memory of her dear old
home,&#8221; said Miss Rose.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Brooks told Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
Rose about the white house on
the hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose we ought to move
back there, now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then
Clematis can go to the Union
School, and grow up like other
children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is wonderful. It is a fairy
story, I am sure,&#8221; she replied,
&#8220;for the fairies must have led
Clematis to your door. She will
be the happiest child alive, when
we tell her.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Clematis was the happiest
girl alive, when they called her in
and told her the whole story.</p>
<p>She climbed into her grandfather&#8217;s
lap, and held his hand,
while Miss Rose told it just like a
fairy tale.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Are we going to live in the
house where all the vines are?&#8221;
she asked, when Miss Rose was
done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear, you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I can stay there always?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Clematis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And will you be my grandpa
always?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up at Mr. Brooks.
He smiled and kissed her hot
cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, little maiden. You shall
be my housekeeper, and we shall
be as happy as robins in an apple
tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Miss Rose went back to
Boston, and told them all the
story.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>The children made her tell it
over and over again. They said
it was better than any fairy tale
they had ever read.</p>
<p>&#8220;And did she really sleep out
in the woods alone?&#8221; asked Sally.</p>
<p>&#8220;And does her grandfather
really and truly have a big white
house on a hill?&#8221; asked Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, yes. It is all true,
every word of it,&#8221; answered Miss
Rose.</p>
<p>Even Clematis could hardly
believe it all, at first.</p>
<p>She followed her grandfather
all about, wherever he went, for
fear he might fly away, and never
come back.</p>
<p>In the golden October, they
moved up to the white house on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
the hill, grandfather, Clematis,
and Deborah.</p>
<p>There Clematis had the room
over the porch, where the vines
climbed around her window. She
could look out each morning, and
see the river, and the lakes, with
the mountains beyond.</p>
<p>She felt a little strange among
all the new people she saw each
day, and she had very much to
learn. But Clematis learned the
best thing of all, to do the best
she could, and she soon grew into
a sweet, useful girl.</p>
<p>Her little friends loved her,
and her teachers helped her, for
she tried to please them, and
never complained because things
were not easy to do.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>When she heard that Sally
and the other girls could hardly
believe her story, she went and
whispered to her grandfather.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you may,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;as many as you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she wrote a letter all her
own self. She invited all the
girls her own age, at the Home,
to visit her the next summer,
and see for themselves.</p>
<p>So if you ever go to Tilton,
you must look about for a strong,
happy girl, with big brown eyes,
who studies her lessons, and
works in the garden, and has the
happiest time any girl ever had,
with her grandfather, in the big
white house on the hill.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
